SUMMARY

All cells employ ATP-powered proteases for protein-
quality control and regulation. In the ClpXP protease,
ClpX is a AAA+ machine that recognizes speciﬁc
protein substrates, unfolds these molecules, and
then translocates the denatured polypeptide through
a central pore and into ClpP for degradation. Here,
we use optical-trapping nanometry to probe the
mechanics of enzymatic unfolding and translocation
of single molecules of a multidomain substrate. Our
experiments demonstrate the capacity of ClpXP
and ClpX to perform mechanical work under load,
reveal very fast and highly cooperative unfolding
of individual substrate domains, suggest a trans-
location step size of 5–8 amino acids, and support
a power-stroke model of denaturation in which
successful enzyme-mediated unfolding of stable
domains requires coincidence between mechanical
pulling by the enzyme and a transient stochastic
reduction in protein stability. We anticipate that
single-molecule studies of the mechanical properties
of other AAA+ proteolytic machines will reveal many
shared features with ClpXP.

INTRODUCTION

In all organisms, AAA+ family molecular machines harness the
energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to power macromolecular
movement, disassembly, remodeling, or degradation (Hanson
and Whiteheart, 2005; White and Lauring, 2007). A prominent
subfamily of these machines function as ATP-dependent prote-
ases, which are essential for protein quality control, help sculpt
and maintain the proteome, and play important regulatory roles
(Baker and Sauer, 2006; Schrader et al., 2009). AAA+ proteases
include ClpXP, ClpAP, ClpCP, HslUV, Lon, FtsH, PAN/20S, and

the 26S proteasome. Each of these enzymes contains a hexame-
ric ring of AAA+ ATPases and a barrel-like peptidase, in which
the proteolytic active sites are concealed within an interior
chamber. Degradation is initiated when loops within the axial
pore of the AAA+ ring engage an unstructured region of a protein
substrate. ATP-fueled conformational changes in the ring are
then thought to produce pulses of pulling that unfold the protein
substrate and translocate it through the pore and into the degra-
dation chamber.

In the ClpXP protease, ClpX recognizes, unfolds, and translo-
cates protein substrates into the chamber of ClpP for degrada-
tion (Figure 1A; for review, see Sauer et al., 2004). Short peptide
sequences, such as the ssrA tag, mediate the initial binding
of substrates to loops within the axial pore of the ClpX ring
(Gottesman et al., 1998; Siddiqui et al., 2004; Martin et al.,
2007, 2008a, 2008b). Each subunit of ClpX consists of an
N domain, which is dispensable for degradation of ssrA-tagged
substrates, and large and small AAA+ domains, which bind ATP
and form the hexameric ring (Singh et al., 2001; Wojtyra et al.,
2003; Martin et al., 2005).

Crystal structures of the ClpX hexamer suggest motions in
which ATP binding and hydrolysis alter the orientation between
the large and small AAA+ domains of a subunit, driving rigid-
body motions around the ring and causing downward motions
of axial-pore loops in contact with a substrate (Glynn et al.,
2009). These movements are then thought to allow ClpX to pull
on the degradation tag, resulting in translocation that wedges
the native substrate against the narrow pore of the AAA+ ring,
leading to eventual unfolding. Subsequent translocation of the
denatured protein into ClpP results in degradation. Interestingly,
translocation does not appear to depend on recognition of
repeating features along the polypeptide ‘‘track,’’ as homopoly-
meric stretches of many chemically diverse amino acids in
addition to unnatural sequences with extra methylene groups
between successive peptide bonds are efﬁciently translocated
by ClpXP (Barkow et al., 2009). Although the mechanism by
which ClpX grips the translocating polypeptide remains incom-
pletely understood, it seems likely that step size is determined

(A) Cartoon of the ClpXP protease midway through
degradation of a multidomain substrate. The
substrate is threaded through the pore of the ClpX
hexamer (yellow-brown). Loops in the pore grip
the substrate, and downward loop movements,
powered by ATP binding and hydrolysis, unfold
each domain and translocate the denatured
polypeptide into the lumen of ClpP (green), where
degradation to small fragments occurs (Ortega
et al., 2000; Siddiqui et al., 2003; Martin et al.,
2008a; 2008b; Glynn et al., 2009).

by the molecular properties of the enzyme rather than the
substrate.

ClpXP can hydrolyze as many as 500 ATPs during unfolding
of a single very stable protein, although the average unfolding
cost for less stable substrates can be as low as 10 ATPs (Kennis-
ton et al., 2003, 2004). Each ATP-driven conformational cycle
in ClpXP probably represents a new unfolding attempt, implying
that most efforts to denature high-cost substrates are unsuc-
cessful. Why are low-cost substrates denatured after a few
attempts, whereas most attempts to denature high-cost sub-
strates fail? Because the enzyme and substrate should have
no ‘‘memory’’ of previous encounters, random factors, such as
transient structural distortions caused by thermal ﬂuctuations,
are likely to change the probability of unfolding. For example,
such ﬂuctuations could weaken the substrate structure near
the degradation tag, making unfolding easier when coincident
with ClpXP pulling on the tag.

Single-molecule experiments can reveal aspects of molecular
mechanism that are difﬁcult to establish by experiments that
measure the average properties of large populations of enzymes
and substrates. Here, we use optical-trapping nanometry to
assay the mechanics of unfolding and translocation during
ClpXP degradation of single molecules of a model substrate
containing multiple domains. We demonstrate that ClpXP
sequentially unfolds and translocates each successive domain
of
this substrate in a highly localized and unidirectional
fashion. Most unfolding events are very fast, with less than
1 ms between the start and ﬁnish of the reaction, and are highly
cooperative, with intermediates detected in only 15% of all
cases. Subsequent ClpXP translocation of the unfolded sub-
strate proceeds in a stepwise fashion, with the smallest resolved

258 Cell 145, 257–267, April 15, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc.

steps being 5–7 amino acids. In contrast to the very fast time
of domain unfolding, ClpXP often spent much longer periods
attempting to denature an engaged domain, supporting
models in which successful enzyme-mediated denaturation
requires mechanical pulling to coincide with transient reductions
in substrate stability. Our results demonstrate that ClpXP can
perform at least 5 kT of work per translocation step and
support a power-stroke model of forcible denaturation of protein
substrates.

RESULTS

Substrate and Experimental Design
To assay single-molecule mechanical activity, we tethered
a complex of ClpXP and a multidomain substrate between two
polystyrene beads, held in a dual laser-trap conﬁguration (Fig-
ure 1B). As shown in Figure 1C, the substrate contained an
N-terminal HaloTag protein (Los and Wood, 2007), eight distinct
immunoglobulin-like domains of the naturally occurring ﬁlamin-A
protein (FLN; Fucini et al., 1997), and a C-terminal ssrA tag to
target it to ClpXP (Gottesman et al., 1998). A 3500 base-pair
0
end and a biotin
DNA molecule, with a HaloTag ligand on one 5
0
on the opposite 5
end, was used to attach the substrate to
a streptavidin-coated bead and to provide a spacer between
the substrate and bead. Cecconi et al. (2005) ﬁrst used DNA as
a spacer and tether for force-induced studies of protein unfold-
ing,
linking these molecules by disulﬁde bonds. Because
reducing agents are important for robust ClpXP activity but
would cleave disulﬁdes, we used the HaloTag domain to allow
an alternative method of covalent linkage to the DNA. A biotiny-
lated single-chain ClpXDN hexamer complexed with ClpP was

Figure 2. Single-Molecule Unfolding and Translocation by ClpXP
(A) Representative extension-versus-time traces of unfolding and translocation events, accompanying ClpXP degradation of the multidomain substrate at
different forces using 2 mM ATP. Traces are offset on the y axis to avoid overlap. Gray lines represent raw data following decimation; colored lines represent
averages over a 10-point sliding window. Red segments represent FLN domains; blue segments represent the HaloTag domain; green segments represent
translocation of the 47-residue linker between the HaloTag domain and FLN1. Dwells between FLN subunits unfolding in the top 8 pN trace were spaced at 4 nm
(insert), which is the length of a folded FLN domain (Furuike et al., 2001). No traces contained eight FLN unfolding events, presumably because C-terminal FLN
domains were unfolded and translocated before measurements began.
(B) Plots of force versus unfolding extension minus native length (NL) for FLN domains (red symbols; mean ± SEM) or the HaloTag domain (blue symbols). The red
line is a WLC force-extension model with a contour length (37.3 nm) and a ﬁtted persistence length (0.61 nm) consistent with reported values for FLN domains
(Furuike et al., 2001). For the HaloTag domain, NL was 3.3 nm, the native distance between Asp106 and the HaloTag C terminus; Asp106 forms a covalent bond
with the HaloTag ligand (Los and Wood, 2007) on the DNA linker. The blue WLC curve was calculated with a persistence length of 0.61 nm and a ﬁtted contour
length of 62.1 nm, a value within 7% of previous measurements (Taniguchi and Kawakami, 2010).
(C) Raw data showing four independent FLN-unfolding transitions (offset on the x axis for clarity). The three transitions on the left occurred without detectable
intermediates and within 1 ms, as did 85% of all unfolding transitions. The rightmost transition occurred in two stages, as expected for an unfolding inter-
mediate, but was still complete within 5 ms; 15% of FLN unfolding events behaved similarly.

attached to a second streptavidin-coated bead (Martin et al.,
2005; Shin et al., 2009).

To assemble this system, a glass-binding peptide aptamer
(Aubin-Tam et al., 2010) was used to tether beads to a coverslip,
substrate was attached to the beads, and a substrate-bound
tethered bead was positioned close to an optically trapped
ClpXP bead by moving the coverslip. Recognition of the ssrA
tag and substrate engagement by ClpXP was veriﬁed by inter-
bead tension. The substrate-bound bead was then captured
by a second, stiffer trap, severing the aptamer connection to
the glass surface. The stiffness and positions of the traps were
adjusted to achieve a passive force-clamp geometry (Greenleaf
et al., 2005), allowing movement of the ClpXP bead to maintain
constant tension in response to the changes in substrate length
that occur during degradation. The distance between the two
beads should increase when ClpXP unfolds a domain, thereby
increasing the observed substrate length, decrease when
ClpXP moves along the substrate degrading the unfolded poly-
peptide, and remain constant while ClpXP works to unfold the
next domain (Figure 1D). Each experiment terminates when the
connections between enzyme and substrate, enzyme and
bead, or substrate and bead are lost.

Single-Molecule Unfolding and Translocation
We used our assay to observe the events that occur during
ClpXP degradation of single substrate molecules under different
applied loads (Figure 2A). Each trace consisted of abrupt upward

steps, consistent with single-domain unfolding events, followed
by slower downward movements, consistent with immediate
translocation of the resulting unfolded polypeptide, followed by
motionless periods or dwells, consistent with ClpXP working to
unfold the next domain. At higher loads, a few unfolding events
(less than 4%) were followed by a long dwell period rather
than translocation, consistent with force-induced unfolding of
a substrate domain that is not in contact with ClpXP (not shown).
In Figure 2A, events ascribed to ClpXP unfolding and transloca-
tion of FLN domains of the substrate are colored red, whereas
those assigned to HaloTag domains are blue. We identiﬁed these
individual events based on multiple observations. (1) Unfolding
of the 98-residue FLN domains resulted in 14–19 nm increases
in bead separation, corresponding to the expected length differ-
ence between a denatured and a native FLN domain (Figure 2B,
red symbols), calculated using a worm-like chain (WLC) force-
extension model to estimate the length of the unfolded domain
(Bustamante et al., 1994; Schlierf et al., 2007; Ferrer et al.,
2008). (2) The substrate contains eight FLN domains (Figure 1C),
and multiple sequential FLN unfolding events were observed,
with the intervening dwell positions spaced at 4 nm intervals,
the native domain length (Figure 2A, inset). (3) Unfolding of
the larger HaloTag domain resulted in larger increases in bead
separation (21–36 nm), again consistent with a denatured state
described by a WLC model
(4)
When present, HaloTag-domain unfolding events were always
(Figure 2A), as expected for ClpXP degradation
terminal

(Figure 2B, blue symbols).

Figure 3. ClpX Unfolding and Translocation
Experiments with ClpXSC alone showed some
upward steps consistent with single-domain FLN
unfolding and subsequent
translocation (red
regions). Highly cooperative unfolding transitions
were observed (insert) in these regions. In the
black regions, many upward steps were too
large to represent single-domain unfolding, were
frequently not
followed by translocation, and
probably correspond to load-induced backward
slipping of substrate segments that had already
been unfolded/translocated by ClpX. Following
translocation through the ClpX pore, portions of
the substrate may interact with the bead, refold, or
be engaged by another ClpXSC enzyme, further
complicating analysis. The combined forward
and backward motions result in a slow rate of
net tracking along the substrate (e.g., in both
middle traces there is no net forward movement
between 150 and 500 s). Mean velocities from
Gaussian ﬁts (±95% conﬁdence interval) of the
distribution of translocation velocities for ClpXSC
were 21.1 ± 2.9 aa s-1 at 4-8 pN and 18.3 ±
2.2 aa s-1 at 8–12 pN.

progressing from the C terminus to the N terminus of the
substrate. (5) A 47-residue linker separates FLN1 from the Halo-
Tag domain (Figure 1C, colored green). Consistently,
the
spacing between the dwell positions ﬂanking FLN1-unfolding
events was correspondingly larger than between other FLN-
unfolding events (Figure 2A). Taken together, the single-mole-
cule traces support a processive degradation model in which
ClpXP sequentially unfolds and translocates each successive
domain of the substrate, with both reactions localized to the
substrate domain in immediate contact with the enzyme (Lee
et al., 2001; Kenniston et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2008c).

Biochemical experiments have shown that ClpX alone can
unfold protein substrates, but at a rate 2-3 fold slower than
ClpXP (Kim et al., 2000; Burton et al., 2001; Joshi et al., 2004;
Martin et al., 2007). Indeed, in single-molecule experiments
using single-chain ClpXDN without ClpP, we also observed
substrate unfolding and translocation (Figure 3). Some unfolding
and translocation events appeared similar to those observed
for ClpXP, but many upward steps were far too large for
single-domain unfolding and probably represent load-induced
slipping of large segments of already unfolded and translocated
substrate back through the ClpX pore. Engaged substrates are
known to be released from ClpXP during attempts to denature
very stable domains (Lee et al., 2001; Kenniston et al., 2005;
Martin et al., 2008b, 2008c). We did not observe large-scale
substrate slippage in the single-molecule ClpXP experiments,
but such events are likely to sever the connection between
ClpXP and the partially degraded substrate, ending the experi-
ment. Because ClpXP unfolding and translocation events were
better behaved and could be conﬁdently assigned, the experi-
ments and analyses below focus on these reactions.

Rapid and Cooperative Domain Unfolding
The unfolding traces provide important information about the
speed and cooperativity of domain denaturation by ClpXP.

260 Cell 145, 257–267, April 15, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc.

Notably, for 85% of the FLN or HaloTag unfolding events, the
increase in substrate length that accompanied denaturation
occurred within the operational sampling time of
less than
1 ms. The leftmost three traces in Figure 2C show representa-
tive examples of fast, highly cooperative denaturation without
detectable intermediates. For the remaining 15% of unfolding
events, denaturation occurred in two stages, but was still
complete within 5 ms. The right trace in Figure 2C shows an
example of this class of event, which is expected for a reaction
with a transiently populated unfolding intermediate. We also
observed fast, highly cooperative unfolding of ﬁlamin domains
in experiments using ClpX alone (Figure 3, inset).

The dwell periods prior to abrupt unfolding represent the time
required for successful ClpXP denaturation. Strikingly, some
FLN-unfolding events closely followed completion of the prior
translocation reaction, whereas others required more than
100 s (Figure 2A and Figure 4A). Importantly, large variations
in pre-unfolding dwell times were observed between different
experiments and within single experiments in which one enzyme
tracks along the substrate (Figure 2A). Many futile ATP-hydro-
lysis cycles are likely to occur during the long dwell periods.
Indeed, the steady-state rate of ATP hydrolysis was 2.2 s-1
enz-1 during ClpXP degradation of our multidomain substrate
(a value that includes unfolding and translocation) and increased
to 3.6 s-1 enz-1 during degradation of a model unfolded substrate
(a value that should represent translocation alone; Figure 4B).
Depending on the force and speciﬁc experiment, analysis of
the unfolding-translocation traces showed that ClpXP spent
66%–75% of the time working to unfold individual domains of
the substrate. Thus, the average ATPase rate during ClpXP
unfolding should be 1.7-1.9 s-1 enz-1, indicating that an average
of 170-190 ATP molecules would be hydrolyzed during an
unfolding dwell of 100 s.

The very fast and highly cooperative nature of ClpXP-induced
unfolding for the domains studied here rule out models in which

niston et al., 2003). Symbols are averages (±SD)
based on independent replicates (n R 3). The solid

et al., 2003; Hersch et al., 2005).
(C) Dwell times were combined, plotted as cumu-
lative frequencies, and ﬁtted to a triple-exponential
function, yielding rate constants of 3.4 ± 0.16 s-1
(amplitude 35 ± 1%), 0.23 ± 0.02 s-1 (amplitude
47 ± 2%) and 0.03 ± 0.01 s-1 (amplitude 18 ± 2%).
The inset shows the residuals for single, double,
and triple exponential ﬁts.
(D) Single-exponential ﬁts of cumulative frequen-
cies versus pre-unfolding dwell times for FLN2
events (ﬁlled squares; k = 0.20 ± 0.04 s-1), FLN1
events (open squares; k = 0.04 ± 0.01 s-1), and
HaloTag events (circles; k = 0.04 ± 0.02 s-1).

unfolding requires a large number of ATP-hydrolysis events
because the substrate is denatured a few amino acids at
a time. However, our results support the idea that only some
ClpXP pulling events result in successful denaturation because
of stochastic ﬂuctuations in the mechanical stability of the target
domain or in the unfolding power of ClpXP, resulting in the hydro-
lysis of many ATPs and correspondingly long periods of time
before domain unfolding occurs.

The distribution of dwell times preceding FLN unfolding events
did not vary signiﬁcantly with applied load (Figure 4A). Dwell
times were combined, arranged in ascending order, and
assigned a number (cumulative frequency) representing the total
number of events with that or a smaller value. A plot of cumula-
tive frequency versus dwell time (Figure 4C) was ﬁt well by a
triple-exponential function with rate constants of 3.4 ± 0.16 s-1
(amplitude 35 ± 1%), 0.23 ± 0.02 s-1 (amplitude 47 ± 2%) and
0.03 ± 0.01 s-1 (amplitude 18 ± 2%). Because the sequence
of each FLN domain in the substrate is different (pairwise
homology 20%–40%),
they also have
different stabilities. Distinct stability classes could account for
the different exponential classes. Indeed, for the small number
of unfolding events that could be conﬁdently ascribed to FLN1,
FLN2, or the HaloTag-domain, the dwell distributions were ﬁtted
(R2 0.93-0.97) by single-exponential functions with rate
well
constants of 0.04 s-1 for FLN1 and the HaloTag domain and
0.2 s-1 for FLN2 (Figure 4D). We cannot eliminate the possibility
that more data would reveal some multi-exponential character
for each domain, but the clear differences between the FLN1

it seems likely that

and FLN2 distributions support a role for domain heterogeneity
in the overall distribution. An exponential distribution of dwell
times for a speciﬁc domain is consistent with a model in which
stochastic ﬂuctuations render only some engaged domains
susceptible to ClpXP-induced unfolding at any given time.
Notably, the fastest exponential phase for the pooled FLN
domains had a rate constant (3.4 s-1) near the upper end of the
range for ATP hydrolysis during unloaded ClpXP degradation
(2.2-3.6 s-1 enz-1; Figure 4B), suggesting that unfolding of
some FLN domains requires hydrolysis of just one ATP molecule.

Translocation Velocity and Force Dependence
We calculated ClpXP translocation velocities from the slopes of
traces following 232 individual unfolding events, resulting in the
distributions shown in Figure 5A. Slopes were initially calculated
in units of nm s-1 and were then converted to amino acids (aa) s-1
using a WLC model. ClpXP translocation slowed as the resisting
force increased, with mean rates of 30 aa s-1 at loads of 4–8 pN
and 15 aa s-1 at loads of 16–20 pN (Figure 5B).

In biochemical experiments, the rates of ClpXP translocation
and ATP hydrolysis are linearly related (Martin et al., 2008c).
Thus, slowing ATP turnover should slow single-molecule translo-
cation. In fact, the average translocation rate decreased 35%
when the ATP concentration was reduced from 2 mM to 75 mM
(Figure 5C). This decrease is consistent with a KM of 40 mM
at a load of 8–12 pN; in unloaded experiments, KM for steady-
state ATP hydrolysis was 30 mM during degradation of an
unfolded substrate (Figure 4B). When ClpXP was fueled by

a mixture of 1 mM ATP and 1 mM ATPgS, which ClpXP
hydrolyzes slowly (Burton et al., 2003; Martin et al., 2008c),
the single-molecule translocation rate also dropped 80%
(Figure 5C).

The force dependence of the average ClpXP translocation
velocity ﬁt well to a single-barrier Boltzmann equation (Figure 5B;
Wang et al., 1998): v = v0,(1+A)/(1+A,eFd/kT), where k is the
Bolztmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, n0 is the
ﬁtted unloaded velocity (32 ± 4 aa s-1), d is the ﬁtted distance
between the enzyme ground state and transition state (0.7 ±
0.4 nm), and A is the ﬁtted ratio of times associated with force-
dependent versus force-independent reaction steps (0.05 ±
0.1). The small value of A suggests that a force-independent
reaction is normally rate limiting for overall ClpXP translocation.
Notably, n0 was similar to unloaded ClpXP translocation rates
(27–39 aa s-1) calculated from single-molecule and biochemical
experiments using different substrates (Martin et al., 2008c;
Shin et al., 2009). Extrapolation based on the single-barrier
Boltzmann model predicts that translocation would reach 5%
of n0 at 33 pN, and ClpXP would stall at a slightly higher force.

Stepwise Translocation
Prior studies indicate that the conformational change that allows
ClpXP to translocate polypeptides is generated by hydrolysis of
one ATP (Martin et al., 2005; 2008c) but also show that translo-
cation does not require a ﬁxed spacing of substrate side chains
or peptide bonds (Barkow et al., 2009). The latter property, which
is probably important in allowing translocation of polypeptide
segments with highly diverse chemical and physical properties,
suggests that the translocation step need not be an integral
or even a constant value.
In the clearest individual traces
(Figures 6A–6G), the smallest discernable ClpXP translocation
steps were 1 nm, corresponding to 6 amino acids based on
a WLC model. Analysis of pairwise distance distributions
showed main peaks corresponding to steps of 5.7–7.1 and

262 Cell 145, 257–267, April 15, 2011 ª2011 Elsevier Inc.

10–13 residues (Figure 6H). Based on these results, each
ClpXP translocation step would move 5–7 amino acids, with
the longer 10–13 residue increments corresponding to sequen-
tial but unresolved steps. Dividing n0 by the average ATP-hydro-
lysis rate during steady-state ClpXP degradation of an unfolded
substrate yields 9 ± 1 residues per ATP hydrolyzed, a value inter-
mediate between the shorter and longer steps. It is possible,
therefore, that some hydrolysis events result directly in the
longer 10–13 residue steps. For ClpX alone, the smallest physical
steps ranged from 6.2–7.7 residues (Figure 7).

DISCUSSION

We employed optical trapping nanometry to observe single
ClpXP or ClpX molecules engage and denature a multidomain
substrate. The design of our substrate allowed identiﬁcation
of speciﬁc ClpXP unfolding and translocation events. For
example, the spacing of the dwell periods ﬂanking FLN1-domain
unfolding is larger than for other FLN domains, because the FLN1
domain is separated from the HaloTag domain by a 50-residue
linker. Similarly, ClpXP unfolding of the HaloTag domain results
in a larger
increase in substrate length than unfolding of
FLN domains. For future studies, additional natural or unnatural
sequences or native protein domains could be placed between
FLN1 and the HaloTag domain, allowing single-molecule studies
of ClpXP unfolding and/or translocation of these elements.

We found that the velocity of ClpXP translocation decreases
as the resisting force increased, indicating that at least one reac-
tion in the overall translocation process is force dependent.
However, the A value determined from ﬁtting to the single-barrier
Boltzmann model was far below 1, suggesting that a mechanical
step is not rate limiting in the absence of an applied force. RNA
polymerase also has a very low A value, and force-independent
pyrophosphate release is known to be rate limiting for this
enzyme (Wang et al., 1998). Based upon the A value of 0.05 for

Figure 6. Visualization of Individual ClpXP Translocation Steps
(A)-(G) For the y axis of each panel, the black numbers represent amino acids, assuming a WLC model with a persistence length of 0.61 nm (see Figure 2B legend),
and the red numbers represent changes in bead-bead distance in nm. In panels (A)–(C), the black vertical bars represent the smallest steps resolved. Experiments
were performed using 2 mM ATP (A-E), 75 mM ATP (F), or 1 mM ATP plus 1 mM ATPgS (G). Asterisks mark events that appear to be minor slipping of the substrate
relative to ClpXP, which was more common during translocation under higher loads, at low ATP, or in ATP/ATPgS mixtures.
(H) Power spectra (Svoboda et al., 1993) of pairwise-distance distribution functions of single translocation curves show main peaks near 0.08 and 0.16 aa-1,
corresponding to step sizes of 6.25 (range 5.7–7.1) and 12.5 (range 10–13) amino acids.

ClpXP, it appears that the force-dependent step occurs at a rate
at least 20-fold faster than whatever reaction(s) limit the rate of
translocation and ATP hydrolysis.

Curiously, we did not observe a change in unfolding dwell
times as the force was increased. Because the ATPase rate
and translocation rate appear to be tightly coupled, as shown
here and previously (Martin et al., 2008c), it seems very likely
that the ATPase rate also slows at high forces, and one might
therefore expect a corresponding increase in the average time
required for unfolding. However, we suspect that force-induced
destabilization of the substrate makes denaturation by ClpXP
easier, offsetting any force-induced decrease in ATP-hydrolysis
rates.

Motor proteins operate by power-stroke mechanisms, by
Brownian-ratchet capture of random thermal motions, or by
a combination of these mechanisms (Hwang and Lang, 2009).
The smallest ClpXP and ClpX translocation steps are 5-8
amino acids in length, a size small enough to be driven by plau-
sible structural changes in the ClpX hexamer during a power
stroke (Glynn et al., 2009) or by thermal motion. Although we

cannot rule out some Brownian contributions, we favor a mecha-
nism that relies predominantly on a power stroke for several
reasons. First, the polypeptide substrate is threaded through
the ClpX and ClpXP rings during translocation, an architecture
that results in close enzyme-substrate contacts and favors
a direct-drive mechanism. Second, translocation under load
was highly unidirectional; 150 consecutive forward steps
were observed in some trajectories and reverse steps were
extremely rare, except at the highest loads or at reduced rates
of ATP hydrolysis. Thus, a Brownian mechanism would need to
be exceptionally efﬁcient at capturing thermal motion in the
correct direction and preventing motion in the opposite direction
to account for translocation. Notably, however, ClpXP can trans-
locate substrates from the C terminus to the N terminus or in the
opposite direction and does not require recognition of speciﬁc
spacings of side chains or peptide bonds (Barkow et al., 2009).
Thus, unidirectional capture of thermal motion by binding to
repeating molecular features of the polypeptide track seems
highly unlikely. Third, we observe pre-unfolding dwells that indi-
cate that the folded domain is in intimate contact with the ClpX

Figure 7. Translocation Steps by ClpX Alone
(A–G) For the y axis of each panel, the black numbers represent amino acids, assuming a WLC model with a persistence length of 0.61 nm (see Figure 2B legend),
and the red numbers represent changes in bead-bead distance in nm.
(H) Power spectra of pairwise-distance distribution functions of single translocation curves show main peaks near 0.095 and 0.15 aa-1, corresponding to step
sizes of 6.8 (range 6.2–7.7) and 10.5 (range 10–11) amino acids.

motor, without signiﬁcant motions or slack that would allow
a Brownian mechanism to operate. Finally, it is difﬁcult to envi-
sion a strictly Brownian mechanism that could account for the
ability of ClpXP to accelerate protein-unfolding reactions by
factors as large as 106-fold (Kim et al., 2000), whereas a
power-stroke mechanism has this potential. Consistently, ClpXP
can perform signiﬁcant mechanical work. Indeed, a 1 nm step
against 20 pN of applied load corresponds to 5 kT of mechan-
ical work per step, which would increase to 7.5 kT at the
extrapolated stall force.

How might the pulling activity of the ClpX motor lead to protein
unfolding? Depending upon the stability and unfolding proper-
ties of a domain, ClpXP probably operates using three general
denaturation mechanisms. (1) For meta-stable domains, one
power stoke may result in cooperative denaturation. Indeed,
the shortest unfolding dwells observed in our assays are consis-
tent with events associated with ClpXP hydrolysis of a single
ATP. (2) For more stable domains, each independent power
stroke appears to have some probability of success linked to
transient destabilization of the domain resulting from ﬂuctuations
in thermal energy, although ﬂuctuations in the enzyme could also
contribute to the probabilistic nature of unfolding. Notably, the

largest unfolding dwell times in our assays were longer than
100 s, a period in which ClpXP could hydrolyze 200 ATP mole-
cules. As expected for a model in which the stability of a domain
followed a Boltzmann distribution, the unfolding dwell times for
speciﬁc FLN domains or the HaloTag domain were roughly
exponentially distributed. (3) In principle, some ClpXP unfolding
events could also occur in discrete steps. For example,
if
enzymatic pulling disrupted a small region of protein structure
and translocation of that segment prevented refolding, then the
partially unfolded protein might be sufﬁciently stable to persist.
Under these circumstances, the energy barrier for unfolding of
the remaining structure would be lowered, allowing subsequent
power strokes to complete unfolding (Lee et al., 2001). Approx-
imately 15% of the FLN-unfolding events did show an unfolding
intermediate, but these events also occurred in less than 5 ms,
which is far faster than the average time required for ATP hydro-
lysis (>250 ms). We cannot eliminate models in which a few
coordinated power strokes contribute to these non-cooperative
unfolding events, but the most likely model
is that they also
result from hydrolysis of a single ATP with subsequent thermally
driven denaturation of the remaining elements of native struc-
ture. Thus, the FLN and HaloTag unfolding events observed in

our experiments appear to occur by one of the ﬁrst two mecha-
nisms discussed. Stepwise ClpXP unfolding, which requires
multiple ATP-hydrolysis events, is more likely to be observed
for proteins like GFP and ribonuclease H, in which unfolding
intermediates have higher kinetic or thermodynamic stabilities
than the domains studied here (Hollien and Marqusee, 1999;
Dietz and Rief, 2004; Kenniston et al., 2004; Martin et al., 2008c).
Although protein unfolding and thus degradation can be very
energetically costly (Kenniston et al., 2003), it is important to
note that ClpXP and other AAA+ proteases must denature and
degrade a highly diverse assortment of cellular proteins with
radically different structures and stabilities. Thus, evolution is
unlikely to have optimized ClpXP activity for any single substrate.
Repeated pulling on a peptide tag is a simple mechanism that
allows relatively low-cost degradation of metastable substrates
but eventual high-cost degradation of hyperstable proteins
as well. Some AAA+ family proteases appear to have limited
unfoldase activity and to specialize in degrading poorly struc-
tured proteins (Herman et al., 2003). Because the degradation
of unfolded substrates requires energy consumption that is
inversely proportional to translocation step size, it will be impor-
tant to determine if these proteases employ larger translocation
steps, which minimize the net cost of ATP-fueled degradation
but also limit unfolding power.

ClpXP appears to use a relatively low gear (small step size),
allowing it to work against substantial loads. By contrast, cyto-
plasmic dynein, a dimeric AAA+ machine, takes longer steps
(typically 8 nm) as it moves along the microtubule cytoskeleton
but has a lower stall force (7 pN; Gennerich et al., 2007).
Several molecular motors that track along nucleic acids also
take relatively small steps and can work against substantial
forces, including bacterial RNA polymerase (25 pN; 1 base or
0.4 nm steps; Wang et al., 1998; Abbondanzieri et al., 2005),
the AAA+ F29 DNA-packaging motor (50 pN; 2.5 base-pair
or 0.85 nm steps; Smith et al., 2001; Mofﬁtt et al., 2009), and
the ribosome (>20 pN; 3 base or 1.3 nm steps; Wen et al.,
2008). Moreover, each of these machines encircle the single or
double-stranded nucleic acid. Likewise,
the polypeptide
substrates of ClpXP are threaded through the enzyme, allowing
intimate contacts that maintain processivity even when working
against a substantial resisting force. We anticipate that other
AAA+ machines with relatively small step sizes will also be able
to generate high forces, allowing them to carry out mechanical
work suited to their speciﬁc biological tasks.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Biotinylated ClpXSC, a single-chain variant containing six repeats of E. coli
ClpXDN (residues 61-423), and E. coli ClpP-His6 were prepared as described
(Kim et al., 2000; Shin et al., 2009). The multidomain substrate was constructed
in pFN18A (Promega) and encoded an engineered Rhodococcus rhodochrous
haloalkane dehalogenase (HaloTag) domain at the N terminus (Los and Wood,
2007), a linker of 47 residues containing two TEV protease sites, immunoglob-
ulin repeats 1–8 of human ﬁlamin A (accession CAI43198; residues 279–1066),
residues 5303-5341 of human titin (accession CAA62188; corresponding to
the C-terminal half of the I27 domain), a His6 tag, and a C-terminal AANDEN
YALAA ssrA tag. This substrate was expressed in E. coli strain ERL (Shin
et al., 2009). Cells were initially grown to OD600 0.6 at 37
C in 1 l of LB broth,
C, and induced with 1 mM IPTG. Cells were harvested 3 hr later,

10% glycerol, 20 mM imidazole, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and
C. For puriﬁcation, cells were thawed and lysed using a French
frozen at –80
Press, before addition of 2 mM MgCl2 and 500 units of benzonase nuclease.
C, lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 3 g for 30 min, and
After 30 min at 4
the clariﬁed lysate was passed over a Ni2+-NTA afﬁnity column (QIAGEN).
After washing, bound protein was eluted with buffer containing 250 mM
imidazole and was further puriﬁed by anion-exchange chromatography
(HiTrap Q XL, GE Healthcare) using a 0-0.5 M KCl gradient. Appropriate
fractions were identiﬁed by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and concentrated by
precipitation using 60% saturated ammonium sulfate. Concentrated protein
(1 ml) was loaded onto a S300 HR 16/60 size exclusion column (GE
Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 200 mM KCl, 10%
glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT. After chromatography, fractions
were assayed by SDS-PAGE, pooled, concentrated (Amicon Ultra-30 kDa

The concentration of the multidomain substrate was determined in 6 M
guanidine HCl, 75 mM bicine (pH 8.3) using an extinction coefﬁcient of
133620 M-1 cm-1 at 280 nm.

Steady-state rates of ATP hydrolysis by ClpXSC (110 nM) in the presence of
ClpP-His6 (460 nM) were determined using an NADH enzyme-linked assay
(Kim et al., 2000) in PD buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.6), 10 mM MgCl2, 10%
glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 100 mM KCl, and 0.1% tween-20) at room temperature
(23 ± 1
C). ATPase assays were performed without protein substrate or with
near saturating concentrations (20–30 mM) of our multidomain HaloTag-FLN
substrates or of a model unfolded substrate (carboxymethylated-titinI27-LAA).
A 3500 base-pair DNA linker was constructed by PCR using M13mp18
biotin, and a second
plasmid as template, one oligonucleotide primer with a 5
0
amino group. Following PCR, the 5
oligonucleotide primer containing a 5
amino group was crosslinked to HaloTag thiol (O4) ligand (Promega P6761)
using sulfosuccinimidyl 4-[N-maleimidomethyl]cyclohexane-1-carboxylate,
prior to conjugation to the HaloTag portion of the substrate.

A 10 ml ﬂow cell was prepared with 1 mm streptavidin-coated beads
(Polyscience Inc.), which were tethered to a glass coverslip via a glass-binding
peptide aptamer as described (Aubin-Tam et al., 2010). The biotinylated DNA-
HaloTag-ﬁlamin1-8-ssrA molecule was then introduced into the ﬂow cell, incu-
bated for 30 min, and washed with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PD buffer.
Biotinylated ClpXSC was incubated with 1.26 mm streptavidin-coated polysty-
rene beads (Spherotech Inc.), and the mixture was centrifuged and
resuspended once in PD buffer with 5 mg/ml BSA, 1 mM ClpP, 2 mM ATP,
a creatine-phosphate based ATP-regeneration system, and an oxygen-
scavenging system consisting of 5 mg/ml b-D-glucose, 0.25 mg/ml glucose
oxidase, and 0.03 mg/ml catalase. After ﬂowing 30 ml of the solution containing
ClpXP-bound beads through the ﬂow cell, it was sealed and loaded on
the optical-trapping instrument. Experiments were performed at
room
temperature.

A dual optical trap with a dual detection system was implemented using
a 1064 nm trapping laser (IPG Photonics) and a 975 nm detection laser
(Avanex). Both beams were split using polarizing beam splitters before being
focused at the sample plane with a 100 3 1.4 NA objective (Nikon). One trap
branch was steered with acousto-optic deﬂectors (IntraAction). Nanometer
scale positional resolution was achieved for each bead through isolation of
orthogonal detection beams with a polarizer along the detection branch and
steered toward two position-sensitive devices (PSDs; Paciﬁc Silicon).

The ClpXP bead (1.26 mm) was held in a weak trap (0.01-0.08 pN/nm) and
brought into the vicinity of a surface-bound, aptamer-tethered bead (1 mm)
to allow ClpXP to initiate degradation. The 1 mm bead was then captured by
a stiffer trap (0.2 pN/nm), and the stage was moved to rupture aptamer link-
ages with the glass surface. Bead positions were sampled at 3 kHz, antialias-
ﬁltered at 1.5 kHz, and an acousto-optic deﬂector was used to position the
1.26 mm bead in the passive force-clamp region (Greenleaf et al., 2005),
400 nm from the beam center. At the end of the motility record and after
rupture of the bead-bead connection, each bead was raster scanned through
an automated protocol to calibrate position and stiffness (Lang et al., 2002).
Trap stiffness was obtained using equipartition methods. Bead separation
was isolated from the lab frame by subtracting position on PSD1 from
PSD2, removing common-mode noise. Applied load was determined from
the position of the 1 mm bead in the stiffer trap.

The traces shown in Figure 2A, Figure 3, Figure 6, and Figure 7 were ob-
tained by decimating the differential position of beads by a factor of 25 using
an 8th-order low pass Chebyshev Type I ﬁlter, and then averaged with an expo-
nentially weighted 10-point moving average. When translocation of a domain
was nearly constant, velocity was determined by a linear ﬁt of displacement
over time. When several apparent velocities could be distinguished, each
region of relatively constant velocity was computed separately and weighted
by the displacement that occurred at that velocity. Pairwise distance distribu-
tion functions (PDF) were calculated by binning distance differences in single
translocation curves, with a bin width of 0.1 amino acids. Power spectra were
calculated from the PDF by fast Fourier transformation (Svoboda et al., 1993).
