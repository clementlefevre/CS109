SUMMARY

The lissencephaly protein Lis1 has been reported to
regulate the mechanical behavior of cytoplasmic
dynein, the primary minus-end-directed microtubule
motor. However, the regulatory mechanism remains
poorly understood. Here, we address this issue using
puriﬁed proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae
and a combination of techniques, including single-
molecule imaging and single-particle electron micro-
scopy. We show that rather than binding to the main
ATPase site within dynein’s AAA+ ring or its microtu-
bule-binding stalk directly, Lis1 engages the inter-
face between these elements. Lis1 causes individual
dynein motors to remain attached to microtubules for
extended periods, even during cycles of ATP hydro-
lysis that would canonically induce detachment.
Thus, Lis1 operates like a ‘‘clutch’’ that prevents
dynein’s ATPase domain from transmitting a detach-
ment signal to its track-binding domain. We discuss
how these ﬁndings provide a conserved mechanism
for dynein functions in living cells that require pro-
longed microtubule attachments.

INTRODUCTION

To help create the complex internal organization within eukary-
otic cells, the myosin and kinesin motor protein families have
undergone widespread gene duplication and evolution, presum-
ably so they can fulﬁll particular functional niches (e.g., transport-
ing cargos, bearing tension, and sliding ﬁlaments; Vale, 2003).
Accordingly, their members show a spectrum of properties,
with different catalytic rates and structural adaptations. A strik-
ing departure from this pattern is one of the least understood
cytoskeletal motors, cytoplasmic dynein (Figure 1A). This one
motor powers nearly all movement toward the microtubule
minus end in most eukaryotic cells. Its many functions include
transporting and positioning diverse cargos (e.g., mRNAs,

proteins, and organelles) during interphase, exerting tension
between the microtubule network and cell cortex during cell
migration, and helping to construct the spindle during mitosis
and meiosis (Karki and Holzbaur, 1999; Vale, 2003). Regulation
of dynein is therefore critical, and human diseases arise from
its dysfunction (Gerdes and Katsanis, 2005).
In addition to
task-speciﬁc regulators, cytoplasmic dynein has three ubiqui-
tous cofactors that are required for most, if not all, of its functions
across eukaryotes (Kardon and Vale, 2009; Vallee et al., 2012):
the dynactin complex and two proteins analyzed in this study,
Lis1 and Nudel.

Dynein’s ATP-hydrolyzing and track-binding elements are key
potential targets for regulation and differ in three signiﬁcant ways
from those of myosin and kinesin. First, rather than a compact
fold, dynein’s ATPase domain is ring shaped, containing six
covalently linked AAA+ modules (Neuwald et al., 1999; Roberts
et al., 2009). Second, rather than a single site of ATP binding/
hydrolysis, four of dynein’s AAA+ modules (AAA1–AAA4) can
bind nucleotide, with AAA1 being the main site of ATP hydrolysis
(Cho et al., 2008; Gibbons et al., 1991; Kon et al., 2004, 2012;
Schmidt et al., 2012). Finally, instead of close integration of the
track-binding and hydrolysis sites, these domains in dynein are
spatially separated by a 10 nm intramolecular coiled-coil stalk,
which protrudes from AAA4 (Cho and Vale, 2012).

Together, dynein’s architectural features make interdomain
communication a central part of its mechanism and an additional
potential target for regulation. For example, structural changes
within dynein’s AAA+ ring, driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis
at AAA1, produce cyclic changes in the afﬁnity of the microtu-
bule-binding domain at the stalk’s tip (Imamula et al., 2007;
Kon et al., 2004, 2009).
In some distantly related AAA+
ATPases, pulses of structural changes are transmitted around
the ATPase ring with the assistance of arginine ﬁnger motifs
that reach from one subunit into the active site of the neighboring
subunit (Erzberger and Berger, 2006). However, the extent to
which dynein uses similar mechanisms is unknown.

A strong candidate for altering the structural changes within
dynein is the evolutionarily conserved protein Lis1. Mutations
in the human LIS1 gene cause classical lissencephaly, a severe
brain development disorder (Reiner et al., 1993). In brain slices

and cultured cells, perturbing Lis1 levels causes defects in
dynein-mediated processes such as nuclear migration, mitosis,
and cargo transport (Ding et al., 2009; Faulkner et al., 2000;
Pandey and Smith, 2011; Smith et al., 2000; Tai et al., 2002;
Tanaka et al., 2004; Tsai et al., 2007; Yi et al., 2011). Like cyto-
plasmic dynein’s force-generating subunit, Lis1 is dimeric.
Each Lis1 protomer contains an N-terminal dimerization domain
and a C-terminal b-propeller domain that binds to the dynein
motor domain (Figure 1A; Sasaki et al., 2000; Tai et al., 2002;
Tarricone et al., 2004). A coiled-coil protein, Nudel
(or its
paralogue, NudE), is thought to further tether Lis1 to dynein
(McKenney et al., 2010), allowing Lis1 to function at lower
concentrations in vivo (Eﬁmov, 2003; Li et al., 2005; Wang and
Zheng, 2011; _Zy1kiewicz et al., 2011). In Saccharomyces cerevi-
siae, the Lis1 and Nudel orthologs (Pac1 and Ndl1, respectively)
serve to concentrate dynein at the plus ends of microtubules
(Lee et al., 2003; Li et al., 2005; Sheeman et al., 2003). This is
a critical step in targeting dynein to the cell membrane, where
it positions the nucleus during cell division.

A range of properties has been ascribed to Lis1, including
slowing dynein-driven microtubule sliding in multiple motor
assays, prolonging dynein stall events under
load, and
enhancing the microtubule afﬁnity of dynein when ADP and Vi
(a phosphate analog) are bound (McKenney et al., 2010; Tori-
sawa et al., 2011; Yamada et al., 2008). However, Lis1’s mech-
anism of action remains largely mysterious, in part because of
the lack of a recombinant system in which both Lis1 and dynein
can be manipulated and studied at the single-molecule level.
Although reports have suggested that Lis1 binds the AAA1
module of dynein (Sasaki et al., 2000; Tai et al., 2002), this
has not been tested with functional proteins, and structural
information on the dynein/Lis1 complex is not yet available.
Moreover, reconciling the reported in vitro effects of Lis1 and
Nudel with speciﬁc dynein activities in vivo has been contro-
versial (Allan, 2011).

Here,

from
S. cerevisiae, we show that Lis1 engages dynein at AAA3/
AAA4. From this site, Lis1 acts like a ‘‘clutch’’ to regulate commu-
nication between dynein’s catalytic ring and microtubule-binding
stalk, promoting a microtubule-bound state. Supporting these
results, we identify mutations at the AAA3/4 junction that drasti-
cally impair Lis1 binding and motility regulation in vitro and
dynein function in vivo. In addition, we identify an arginine ﬁnger
motif within AAA4 and ﬁnd that its mutation mimics aspects of
Lis1’s effect in vitro. Previous genetic studies in an evolutionarily
distant ﬁlamentous fungus showed that the same mutation can
partially rescue Lis1 loss in vivo (Zhuang et al., 2007). These
results allow us to propose how Lis1 biases dynein to a microtu-
bule attached-state and assists in a variety of cellular functions
across eukaryotes.

RESULTS

Lis1 Promotes a Microtubule-Attached State in Single
Dynein Molecules
To dissect how Lis1 and Nudel regulate dynein’s motility, we
wanted a system in which all three components could be manip-
ulated and studied at the single-molecule level (Figure 1A). We

previously developed methods to purify native cytoplasmic
dynein complexes from S. cerevisiae, ﬂuorescently label them
with tetramethylrhodamine (TMR; via a C-terminal HaloTag),
and visualize their movement along immobilized microtubules
(Reck-Peterson et al., 2006). Here, we puriﬁed Lis1 and Nudel
(Figure 1B), which were expressed from their genomic loci in
S. cerevisiae. We inserted cleavable tags for afﬁnity puriﬁcation
and a C-terminal SNAP-tag (giving the option of covalent
labeling). The 20-kDa SNAP-tag did not interfere with the func-
tion of either protein, as revealed in nuclear segregation assays
(Figure 1C). We eliminated the risk of endogenous regulators
(Lis1, Nudel, and dynactin) from copurifying with dynein via
genomic deletions (Table S1 available online).

We began by observing dynein motility at the single-molecule
level over a range of Lis1 concentrations. In the absence of Lis1,
dynein bound to and traveled along microtubules with a
mean velocity of 100 nm/s (Figure 1D), similar to previous
reports (Reck-Peterson et al., 2006). As the Lis1 concentration
increased, two trends were apparent. First, dynein velocity
became progressively slower, reaching 7 nm/s at the highest
Lis1 concentration tested (1,200 nM). This can be appreciated
in the kymographs in Figure 1D, in which steeper lines indicate
slower movement. Second, Lis1 increased the length of time
that dynein remained attached to the microtubule. For example,
at 1,200 nM Lis1, many dynein molecules were attached for the
entire duration of a 10 min movie (seen in Figure 1D as lines that
span the kymograph’s y axis; see Figures S1A–S1D for quantiﬁ-
cation). Control assays with kinesin showed that the effect of
Lis1 is speciﬁc to dynein (Figures S1E and S1F). Thus we
conclude that Lis1 can convert dynein to a mechanochemical
state in which its velocity is slowed and its microtubule attach-
ments are prolonged.

Notably, at a given Lis1 concentration, the population of
dynein molecules responded similarly: velocity histograms re-
mained unimodal as the mean decreased (Figure 1F). We plotted
dynein’s velocity as a function of Lis1 concentration. The plot is
well ﬁtted by a hyperbolic curve with a maximal velocity reduc-
tion of 95.7 ± 3.1% (Figure 1G; Table S2A). These data show
that saturating concentrations of Lis1 can almost entirely arrest
dynein on the microtubule. The Lis1 concentration giving half-
in this assay is 60.1 ±
maximal velocity reduction (K1/2)
10.0 nM. Hereafter, we refer to dynein in the presence of near-
saturating Lis1 concentrations (>5-fold higher than the K1/2) as
dynein/Lis1.

We next tested whether Nudel, Lis1 and dynein’s binding
partner, affects the behavior of single dynein molecules
in vitro. At 37.5 nM, Nudel alone had little effect on dynein motility
(Figures S1G and S1H). By contrast, a mixture of 37.5 nM Nudel
and 37.5 nM Lis1 elicited a change in dynein behavior akin to that
induced by a 5-fold higher Lis1 concentration. The mean
velocity was slowed to 29 nm/s, and microtubule encounters
were markedly prolonged (Figures 1E and S1H). These results
show interesting similarities and differences compared with
earlier work. In previous in vitro experiments, mammalian Nudel
was found to dissociate dynein from microtubules and suppress
Lis1’s effect on the velocity of unloaded dynein (McKenney et al.,
2010; Yamada et al., 2008). In contrast, we ﬁnd that Nudel from
S. cerevisiae allows Lis1 to exert its effect on dynein at lower

observations from previous experiments in living fungi and frog

et al., 2005; Wang and Zheng, 2011; _Zy1kiewicz et al., 2011).

The Lis1 b Propeller Domain Contains Regulatory
Elements that Act on Dynein’s Motor
To test which structural domains are required for Lis1 to regulate
dynein motility, we analyzed the motility of a well-characterized
dimeric motor domain construct (GST-dynein331 kDa; Reck-

Peterson et al., 2006). GST-dynein331 kDa, which lacks the
N-terminal tail, endogenous dimerization motif, and binding sites
for associated dynein subunits, contains two motor domains
dimerized by GST (Figure 2A) and displays processive motility
similar to that of native dynein. In the absence of Lis1, GST-
dynein331 kDa traveled along microtubules with a mean velocity
of 116 nm/s (Figure 2B). Strikingly, Lis1 also reduced the
velocity and prolonged microtubule attachments of GST-
dynein331 kDa in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 2B and
S2A–S2D; Table S2B). The maximal velocity reduction was
similar to that observed in native dynein (Figure 2C), but the

K1/2 of Lis1 is lower (15 nM). This difference is consistent with

the notion that the afﬁnity of Lis1 for dynein increases when
dynein’s tail domain is removed (Markus et al., 2009; Reck-
Peterson et al., 2006). These results indicate that Lis1 regulates
dynein motility by acting on elements within the motor domain.
We next tested whether dimerization of either Lis1 or dynein is
an essential part of the regulatory mechanism, using puriﬁed
monomeric dynein331 kDa, whose motor activity can be analyzed
using a microtubule gliding assay (Figure 2D). To produce mono-
meric Lis1 (Lis1DN), we removed Lis1’s N-terminal dimerization
domain. The monomeric state of Lis1DN was veriﬁed by size-
exclusion chromatography (Figure 2E) and crosslinking (Fig-
ure S2E). Monomeric dynein331 kDa drove microtubule gliding
at a velocity of 55.5 nm/s (Figure 2F). Signiﬁcantly, in the pres-
ence of 800 nM Lis1DN, gliding velocity slowed by 60% (to
21.5 nm/s) and decreased by 70% (to 16.2 nm/s) when the
Lis1DN concentration was increased to 1,600 nM. These data
indicate that a single b-propeller domain of Lis1 can regulate
the activity of a single dynein motor domain, provided it is
supplied at an elevated concentration (perhaps explaining why
similar effects were not observed in a previous study; Torisawa
et al., 2011).

We next tested these ﬁndings in living cells. Yeast expressing
monomeric Lis1DN as the sole source of Lis1 exhibited a strong

nuclear segregation defect (22%; Figure 2G), consistent with
malfunction of the dynein pathway. However, when the cellular
concentration of Lis1DN was increased >10-fold with the use
of a strong, galactose-inducible promoter (Figure S2G), the
percentage of cells with a nuclear segregation defect was
rescued to 10% (Figure 2G). This suggests that a monomeric
Lis1 construct comprising the b-propeller domain can regulate
dynein both in vitro and in vivo, provided its concentration is
sufﬁciently high. Thus, dimerization serves to enhance the
apparent afﬁnity between dynein and Lis1.

Lis1 Alters Allosteric Communication between Dynein’s
ATPase and Microtubule-Binding Domains
In principle, dynein could be converted to a microtubule-
attached state by arresting its ATPase cycle at a stage corre-
sponding to strong microtubule afﬁnity (e.g., with ADP or no
nucleotide bound). Previous ATPase results obtained with
brain-puriﬁed dynein in the presence of Lis1 have varied
(McKenney et al., 2010; Mesngon et al., 2006; Yamada et al.,
2008), perhaps due to heterogeneity between and within dynein
preparations. To test for Lis1-induced catalytic arrest in our
system, we measured the ATPase activity of dynein with different
concentrations of Lis1 and microtubules. The basal ATPase rate
of GST-dynein331 kDa alone was activated by microtubules to

 1 (Figure 3A). Addition
a maximal rate of 10.8 motor-domain
of Lis1 also activated the basal ATPase rate (Figure 3B), indi-
cating that Lis1 binding alters turnover in one or more of dynein’s
catalytic AAA+ modules. Interestingly, in the presence of micro-
tubules, the maximal ATPase rate of GST-dynein331 kDa/Lis1
retained 90% of the value for GST-dynein331 kDa alone (Fig-

ure 3B). This was the case even in extremely high Lis1 con-
centrations (2 mM; data not shown). Thus, in the presence of
microtubules, dynein/Lis1 can continue to hydrolyze ATP, indi-
cating that Lis1-mediated motility regulation is more complex
than a simple arrest of the ATPase cycle.

In a canonical mechanochemical cycle, dynein’s motor
domain dissociates from the microtubule after ATP binding. In
a dynein dimer, this allows one motor to detach and undergo
a forward excursion along the microtubule while the partnering
motor remains bound. To test whether Lis1 alters this mechano-
chemical coupling, we developed an assay to visualize the
ATP-sensitive interactions of
individual motor domains with
microtubules (Figure 3C). Monomeric, ﬂuorescently labeled
dynein331 kDa molecules were bound to surface-immobilized
microtubules in the absence of nucleotide,
inducing strong
‘‘rigor’’ binding. The molecules appeared as stationary, diffrac-
tion-limited spots by total
reﬂection ﬂuorescence
(TIRF) microscopy and as vertical
lines in kymographs (Fig-
ure 3D). Addition of ATP caused monomeric dynein331 kDa mole-
cules to rapidly dissociate from the microtubule (Figure 3E,
arrow). Dissociation was not due to laminar ﬂow or dilution, as

internal

the molecules remained attached after perfusion with buffer (Fig-
ure 3D, arrow). After ATP-induced dissociation, monomeric
dynein331 kDa was free to diffuse away from the microtubule.
Subsequent rebinding events were short and probably corre-
spond to single turnovers of ATP (Figure 3E). The presence of
Lis1 caused two main differences in these behaviors. First,
instead of dissociating rapidly after ATP addition, dynein331 kDa
remained bound to the microtubule for extended periods
(average duration of 6 s) before detaching (Figures 3F and
S3A). Second, the duration of rebinding events was similarly pro-
longed (Figure S3B). Thus, Lis1 slows the microtubule off-rate of
dynein in ATP conditions. Multiple ATP hydrolysis cycles are
likely to occur during these extended periods of microtubule
attachment (see Figure 3B and data below). These results
suggest a model in which Lis1 alters communication between
dynein’s catalytic AAA+ modules and microtubule-binding stalk,
allowing the motor domain to remain tightly bound to the micro-
tubule even in high ATP concentrations.

Impact of Lis1 on Dynein Stepping Behavior
A prediction of this model
is that Lis1 will cause the motor
domains in a dynein dimer to remain attached to the microtubule
for longer periods between steps, giving rise to slower motion. If
this prediction is correct, then it might be possible to observe
individual steps even at a physiological ATP concentration
(1 mM) without hindering load, conditions under which dynein’s
steps have previously been too rapid to detect. To test this, we

attached a bright, photostable quantum dot (Qdot) to the C
terminus of one of dynein’s motor domains (Figure 4A; Reck-
Peterson et al., 2006). Dynein’s movement along microtubules
could then be tracked with nanometer precision and a temporal
resolution of 100 ms.

As expected, free GST-dynein331 kDa moved rapidly in 1 mM
ATP, and high-precision traces showed smooth rather than step-
wise motion, consistent with a stepping rate that matches or
exceeds the temporal resolution (Figure 4B, green trace). In
contrast, movement in the presence of Lis1 was slow and
exhibited distinct steps, with pauses (‘‘dwells’’)
intervening
between abrupt forward and occasional backward displace-
ments (Figure 4B, red traces). This Lis1-induced stepping
behavior is reminiscent of free dynein in 1 mM ATP, in which
the stepping rate is limited by the rate of ATP binding (Figure 4B,
blue trace). The dynein step size distribution in the presence of
1 mM ATP and Lis1 (Figure S3C) was similar to that previously
reported for dynein alone at low ATP concentration (Reck-
Peterson et al., 2006). Occasional larger displacements in the

Lis1 traces may correspond to ‘‘bursts’’ of multiple rapid steps
at the rate observed for free dynein in 1 mM ATP (Figure 4B,
green trace) and could reﬂect Lis1 dissociation events.
In
summary, we conclude that the slow movement of dynein/Lis1
is not due to smaller forward steps or more frequent back steps
(Figure S3C); rather, it is accounted for by longer dwells between
steps.
Most frequently, dynein/Lis1 paused for 1 s between steps
(Figure 4C), and longer dwells lasting up to 15 s can be seen in
the traces (Figure 4B, asterisk). For comparison, the average
duration of an ATP turnover in steady-state assays was 0.1 s
(Figure 3B). The dwells we observe between individual steps in
the presence of Lis1 may be related to the pauses previously
seen between longer movements in mammalian dynein (see Fig-
ure S3 of McKenney et al., 2010). During Lis1-induced pauses,
the displacement ﬂuctuations of the Qdot were equivalent to
those seen for dynein alone while tightly bound to the micro-
tubule waiting for ATP to bind (in each case, SD = ±4 nm).
Together, these results show that Lis1 causes dynein to remain
tightly attached to the microtubule for typically more than
a second in high concentrations of ATP. This is a pronounced
change from dynein’s canonical stepping pattern.

Lis1 Binds Between Dynein’s Microtubule-Binding
and ATPase Domains at AAA3/4
We next explored the structural basis for the striking effects of
Lis1 on dynein’s mechanochemistry. Using size-exclusion
chromatography, we were able to purify the complex of GST-
dynein331 kDa and Lis1 in buffer supplemented with ATP + Vi,
ATP, or no added nucleotide (Figures 5A and 5B). Complex
formation was evident from the coelution of dynein and Lis1
(Figures 5A, blue arrow, and 5B) and depletion of free Lis1
(Figure 5A, gray arrow). This differs from a previous report in
which interactions were detected in the presence of ATP + Vi
(thought to trap the prepowerstroke state of dynein) but not in
nucleotide-free conditions (McKenney et al., 2010). It may be
that Lis1 afﬁnity in the no-nucleotide state is stronger with
dimeric, yeast dynein compared with the monomeric, mamma-
lian dynein construct used in earlier work. We used electron
microscopy (EM) to investigate structural differences between
the free dynein and dynein/Lis1 fractions in the absence of
nucleotide, allowing direct comparison with the yeast motor
domain crystal structure (Schmidt et al., 2012) obtained in the
same state.

Figure 5C shows negative-stain EM images of GST-
dynein331 kDa both alone and bound to Lis1. Molecules from
the two samples have the same general form, with the paired
motor domains adopting a range of relative orientations about
the GST moiety. However, the two motor domains are slightly
closer and less variably spaced in the presence of Lis1 (Fig-
ure 5D), suggesting that Lis1 might bind between them (see
Figure S4A).

We next mapped the Lis1 binding site on dynein using single-
particle image processing. Images of individual motor domains
were extracted from the dimer micrographs, aligned, classiﬁed
into similar groups, and averaged, revealing a range of molecular
views in the data sets. The two main views of the motor domain
are close to those previously seen in other dyneins (Figures 5E

alone is 21.0 ± 0.2 nm (± error of the ﬁt) and the SD
is 3.1 ± 0.2 nm (n = 854). In the presence of Lis1,
the motor-motor separation is 19.3 ± 0.1 nm and
the SD is 2.1 ± 0.1 nm (n = 1067). The motor-motor
separation is signiﬁcantly reduced in the presence
of Lis1 (p < 0.0001, Welch t test), and the variation
in motor-motor spacing is signiﬁcantly smaller
(p < 0.0001, f test).

and 5F; Burgess et al., 2003; Roberts et al., 2009). Detail was
sufﬁcient to match these views unambiguously to orientations
of the yeast dynein crystal structure (Figures S4B and S4C).
Both the coiled-coil stalk and the microtubule-binding domain
at its tip are also resolved in class averages (Figures 5E and
5F, insets), further aiding interpretation of the images.

In the presence of Lis1, there is a pronounced extra density on
the margin of dynein’s motor domain, near the emergence of the
stalk (Figure 5E, arrowhead). This observation is quantiﬁed in
a difference map, where the additional density gives rise to
a strong difference peak (Figure 5E, right panel). Analysis of
the second main view (Figure 5F) yields a difference peak in
the same position. This extra Lis1 density in both views overlaps
with AAA3/4 (Figures 5E and 5F, lower; Figures S4B–S4E). We
detect no signiﬁcant density changes near AAA1 in the presence

of Lis1, contrary to earlier reports that Lis1 binds AAA1 (Sasaki
et al., 2000; Tai et al., 2002).

To determine whether Lis1 binding at AAA3/4 is responsible
for regulating dynein motility, we mutated a series of highly
conserved, charged amino acids in dynein at this putative inter-
face (Figures 6A and S5A). Whereas these mutations had little or
no effect on dynein’s intrinsic motility, Lis1-induced velocity
reduction was impaired by a single point mutation (K2721E)
and nearly abolished by a quadruple substitution (K2721A,
D2725G, E2726S, and E2727G) near the AAA3/4 junction (Fig-
ure 6B). These four mutations also virtually abolished Lis1
binding in a gel ﬁltration experiment (Figures S5B and S5C).
Furthermore, in living yeast cells, the quadruple substitution
produced a nuclear segregation phenotype indistinguishable
from that caused by Lis1 deletion (Figure 6C). Thus, we conclude

that Lis1 engages dynein at AAA3/4, near the interface between
its catalytic ring and microtubule-binding stalk.

Mutation of Dynein’s AAA4 ‘‘Arginine Finger’’ Mimics the
Lis1 Effect at the Single-Molecule Level
A pre-existing clue to the involvement of AAA3/4 in Lis1’s mech-
anism comes from genetic studies in Aspergillus nidulans. In this
ﬁlamentous fungus, a single Arg/Cys mutation within AAA4 can
partially suppress the phenotype associated with deletion or
mutation of the Lis1 gene (nudF) (Zhuang et al., 2007). On close
inspection, this residue is a strong candidate to form the ‘‘argi-
nine ﬁnger’’ motif of AAA4. By analogy to related ring-shaped
AAA+ ATPases, this motif is expected to reach from AAA4 into
the adjacent nucleotide-binding pocket of AAA3 and help trans-
mit structural changes around the ring (Figure 6D; Erzberger and
Berger, 2006; Kon et al., 2012; Schmidt et al., 2012). To investi-
gate the role of AAA4’s arginine ﬁnger and the consequences of
the suppressor mutation, we engineered the equivalent mutation
(R2911C) in S. cerevisiae dynein. In single-molecule assays,
GST-dyneinR2911C retained the ability to bind to and move
along microtubules. However, its mean velocity was slowed to
5 nm/s, and its microtubule encounters were extended in
time compared with the parental construct with an intact AAA4

arginine ﬁnger (Figure 6E). Strikingly, these properties of the
mutant closely resemble dynein behavior in saturating Lis1
concentrations (Figure 6E). As expected, the Lis1D phenotype
in S. cerevisiae is not rescued by the arginine ﬁnger mutation
(Figure S5D), because here Lis1 is also required for proper
dynein localization (Lee et al., 2003; Markus et al., 2009; Shee-
man et al., 2003). By contrast, in A. nidulans, this mutation
partially bypasses the need for Lis1, likely because dynein local-
ization is less dependent on Lis1 in these cells (Zhang et al.,
2002). In summary, mutating the arginine ﬁnger motif of AAA4
confers motile properties similar to those produced by Lis1;
moreover, the same mutation can in part circumvent the require-
ment for Lis1 in A. nidulans (Zhuang et al., 2007).

DISCUSSION

Our single-molecule and ensemble data illuminate the mecha-
nism by which Lis1 alters cytoplasmic dynein’s mechanical
behavior and assists in its wealth of cellular functions. Based
on these ﬁndings, models for Lis1’s mechanism must take the
following observations into account. First, Lis1 converts single
dynein molecules to a microtubule-attached state in a dose-
dependent fashion, bringing dynein to a virtual standstill at

persist within the ring, the microtubule-binding domain at the
tip of the stalk retains a strong-binding conformation. As a conse-
quence, the ‘‘duty ratio’’ of the motor (i.e., the fraction of the
catalytic cycle spent tightly attached to the track) approaches
unity. From a kinetic standpoint, the microtubule off-rate of the
motor domain following ATP binding is dramatically slowed,
consistent with enhanced microtubule afﬁnity in the ADP-Vi state
(McKenney et al., 2010). Although the results here show that the
dynein-Lis1 complex can be puriﬁed in a variety of nucleotide
states, our data do not exclude nucleotide-dependent changes
in dynein-Lis1 afﬁnity (McKenney et al., 2010); indeed, we think
changes in afﬁnity are likely as dynein’s ring structure ﬂexes
during the ATPase cycle. Interestingly, aspects of Lis1’s effects
(e.g., constitutively strong microtubule binding and activated
ATPase) have been achieved by locking the helices of the stalk’s
coiled coil
in a deﬁned alignment by crosslinking (Kon et al.,
2009). Collectively, these results suggest that Lis1 may affect
the mobility of the helices in dynein’s coiled-coil stalk using
a unique allosteric mechanism involving binding near the stalk’s
base.

The Role of AAA3/4 in Lis1 Interactions and Dynein
Motility
Our structural data, showing that Lis1 binds dynein at AAA3/4
near the interface between its ATP-hydrolyzing ring and microtu-
bule-binding stalk, provide an explanation for how communica-
tion between these elements can be regulated. This is in contrast
to an earlier report based on interactions between overex-
pressed fragments of each protein that suggested that Lis1
binds AAA1 (Sasaki et al., 2000; Tai et al., 2002). Our functional
studies also support a role for AAA3/4 being the site of Lis1
interaction; mutation of four charged amino acids in AAA4’s
N-terminal helix severely impairs Lis1 binding, renders dynein
nearly completely insensitive to Lis1 in motility assays, and phe-
nocopies a Lis1 null allele in living cells. Furthermore, these
charged amino acids are highly conserved in available cyto-
plasmic dynein sequences (Figure S5A), suggesting that binding
at AAA3/4 is likely to be a common feature of Lis1-dynein inter-
actions. A notable exception to this pattern of conservation is
found in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which lacks an obvious
Lis1 ortholog. The AAA3/4 binding site also provides a simple
explanation for why the Lis1-dynein afﬁnity is sensitive to the
‘‘neck’’ region of dynein’s tail (Markus and Lee, 2011; Markus
et al., 2009), as these domains are closely apposed (Burgess
et al., 2003; Roberts et al., 2012).

Although the ATP-driven domain motions within dynein’s ring
have not yet been delineated, our data and recent structural
studies (Kon et al., 2012; Schmidt et al., 2012) suggest that an
‘‘arginine ﬁnger’’ motif, reaching from AAA4 into the catalytic
pocket of AAA3, contributes to the normal function of cyto-
plasmic dynein’s ring. Our functional studies also show that
mutation of this AAA4 arginine ﬁnger mimics aspects of Lis1’s
impact on dynein motility. Based on comparisons with related
ring-shaped AAA+ machines, this motif is expected to be impor-
tant for the hydrolysis of ATP at AAA3 and/or the transmission of
structural changes from AAA3 to AAA4 (Erzberger and Berger,
2006). Consistent with this, the motile properties that we observe
in the AAA4 arginine ﬁnger mutant closely resemble those of

saturating
Lis1
b-propeller domain, acting on a single dynein motor domain,
can elicit these effects. Third, Lis1 alters dynein’s mechano-
chemical coupling: with Lis1 bound, dynein’s motor domain
can remain attached to the microtubule in physiological ATP
concentrations, even while undergoing multiple rounds of hydro-
lysis. This indicates that Lis1 can alter communication between
dynein’s ATP hydrolyzing ring and its microtubule-binding stalk.
Fourth, Lis1 engages dynein close to the interface between
these elements, at AAA3/4.

A ‘‘Clutch’’ Model for Lis1’s Mechanism
We bring these observations and previous results together into
a model for Lis1’s mechanism of action (Figure 7). We ﬁrst
consider a canonical
(Lis1-free) dynein stepping cycle that
begins with the binding of ATP at dynein’s main hydrolytic site
(AAA1; Figure 7A, blue). This initiates motions of AAA+ subdo-
mains within the ring, which are translated into sliding between
the a helices of the coiled-coil stalk. In turn, the afﬁnity of the
microtubule-binding domain at the stalk’s tip is weakened; it
rapidly detaches from the microtubule and then undergoes
a diffusive search for a new binding site.

The main concept of our model is that when Lis1 binds via its
b-propeller domain to dynein’s ring at AAA3/4, the ﬂow of struc-
tural changes from the ring to the stalk is severed (Figure 7B).
This function of Lis1 is reminiscent of a ‘‘clutch’’ that alters trans-
mission between dynein’s AAA+ ‘‘engine’’ and its track-binding
region. Thus, while cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis can

mutants with disrupted ATP binding/hydrolysis motifs in AAA3
(Cho et al., 2008; Kon et al., 2004). An important mechanistic
distinction between the AAA4 arginine ﬁnger mutant and Lis1
is that the mutation appears to substantially reduce ATPase
turnover (Zhuang et al., 2007), whereas Lis1 does not. A possible
role of ATP hydrolysis in the dynein-Lis1 complex is to keep the
system dynamic and therefore adaptable (see below). Because
AAA1 is the principal ATPase site in dynein’s ring, AAA3 and
AAA4 have previously been referred to as ‘‘regulatory’’ AAA+
modules. Here we show that not only do AAA3 and AAA4 regu-
late the motions within dynein’s ring, but they also form the
binding site for Lis1, a ubiquitous cytoplasmic dynein regulator.

The Functional Role of Nudel
We found that Nudel allowed Lis1 to act on dynein at lower
concentrations in our single-molecule experiments. This
supports a tethering role for Nudel, in which it attaches to
dynein’s tail
(via the intermediate chain of dynein) with one
end of its coiled coil and binds to Lis1 with the other (Feng
et al., 2000; McKenney et al., 2010; Niethammer et al., 2000;
Sasaki et al., 2000; Tarricone et al., 2004; Wang and Zheng,
_Zylkiewicz et al., 2011), thus increasing Lis1’s effective
2011;
concentration. However, evidence suggests that within Nudel’s
tethering role exist additional regulatory layers. For example, an
intriguing property of puriﬁed mammalian NudE/Nudel proteins
is to suppress Lis1’s effects on unloaded dynein (Torisawa
et al., 2011; Yamada et al., 2008) while still enabling Lis1 to
prolong dynein’s microtubule attachments under force (McKen-
ney et al., 2010). One possibility here is that Nudel positions Lis1
such that it engages AAA3/4 when dynein is strained. This
would allow dynein/Lis1/Nudel to move rapidly until a high
load is encountered, at which point Lis1 would engage and
resist microtubule detachment. This differs from our results
from S. cerevisiae, in which Nudel enhanced Lis1’s effects on
dynein even in unloaded conditions. Therefore, the load-depen-
dent behavior of dynein, Lis1, and Nudel may vary among
species or as a function of posttranslational modiﬁcation.

Biological Implications
Lis1 has been proposed to facilitate two general steps in the
cytoplasmic dynein pathway: preparing dynein for transport
and allowing dynein to move large, high-load cargos. Our model
(Figure 7) provides a plausible mechanism for both types of Lis1
function and also identiﬁes additional possible roles for dynein/
Lis1 in living cells. A common theme in these functions is that
by acting as a molecular clutch, Lis1 prolongs dynein’s attach-
ments to microtubules.

An initial step in many dynein-mediated transport events is the
targeting of dynein to the plus ends of microtubules, which grow
and shrink near the cell periphery (Kardon and Vale, 2009). Here,
dynein is thought to be loaded with cargo before transporting
these cargo molecules toward the microtubule minus end. In
cells, Lis1 is also concentrated at microtubule plus ends and
can be targeted there either in complex with dynein (as in
S. cerevisiae and possibly mammalian cells) or separately (as
in A. nidulans and Ustilago maydis; Lee et al., 2003; Lenz et al.,
2006; Sheeman et al., 2003; Yamada et al., 2008; Zhang et al.,
2002). In either scenario, our data indicate that binding of Lis1

984 Cell 150, 975–986, August 31, 2012 ª2012 Elsevier Inc.

to dynein at the microtubule plus end will bias dynein toward
a microtubule-attached state. This could increase dynein’s resi-
dence time at the microtubule plus end, assist in the kinetics of
cargo loading, and/or form the starting conﬁguration for motility
toward the minus end. By binding near the neck region of
dynein’s tail, Lis1 may also be involved in ‘‘unmasking’’ the tail
to promote interactions with cargo (Egan et al., 2012; Lenz
et al., 2006; Markus and Lee, 2011; Markus et al., 2009).

In S. cerevisiae, the cue for transferring dynein onto its cargo
protein could also involve the controlled assembly of dynein
with the dynactin complex (Markus and Lee, 2011; Markus
et al., 2009; Woodruff et al., 2009). Formation of the dynein/
dynactin complex may help displace Lis1 and Nudel (McKenney
et al., 2011) and convert dynein from a strongly microtubule-
attached state (with Lis1 bound) to a rapidly moving processive
state (with dynactin bound).

A second, more recently proposed role of Lis1 is to adapt
dynein for tasks involving high loads, such as transporting and
exerting tension on large organelles and cellular structures
(McKenney et al., 2010). By binding near the base of dynein’s
microtubule-binding stalk and causing it to resist detachment,
Lis1 appears ideally suited to facilitate dynein’s tension-bearing
roles. It remains to be seen whether the ATP-driven movements
of dynein’s mechanical element (the ‘‘linker’’) persist with Lis1
bound (Burgess et al., 2003; Kon et al., 2005; Roberts et al.,
2009, 2012).
If so, this might allow dynein/Lis1 to perform
repeated ‘‘tugs’’ on cargo while attached to the microtubule,
thereby maintaining tension. Alternatively, Lis1 might regulate
the linker domain’s motions, as the distal end of the linker
lies in close proximity to the Lis1 binding site at AAA3/4 (Fig-
ure S4E). The impressive duration of dynein’s microtubule
attachments in the presence of Lis1 also provides clues to addi-
tional possible functions in vivo. A subset of macromolecules
and organelles,
including mRNAs and the Golgi apparatus,
appears to require dynein for retention at speciﬁc sites in the
cytoplasm (Delanoue and Davis, 2005; Ding et al., 2009; Lam
et al., 2010). An idea compatible with our data is that tension-
bearing dynein/Lis1 complexes are responsible for anchoring
these cargos in place.

An important question is how Lis1 might assist in the rapid,
dynein-driven transport of large organelles, as was recently re-
ported in neuronal cells (Pandey and Smith, 2011; Yi et al.,
2011). Given that the velocity of these movements (300 nm/s)
exceeds those expected from dynein in saturating Lis1 con-
centrations (Yamada et al., 2008), one possibility is that Lis1 is
substoichiometrically associated with dynein on such cargos.
Alternatives include Lis1 allowing the summation of multiple indi-
vidual dynein forces (McKenney et al., 2010), and Nudel modu-
lating the dynein-Lis1 interaction in a load-sensitive manner.
Quantifying the endogenous copy number of dynein, Lis1, and
Nudel on these cargos by live-cell imaging would help distin-
guish among these possibilities.

In the other classes of cytoskeletal motors, different motile
properties have been achieved by gene duplication and diver-
gent evolution. In the case of cytoplasmic dynein, our results
reveal that Lis1 can generate mechanical diversity by regulating
the structural changes that propagate through dynein’s large
motor domain.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Protein Expression, Puriﬁcation, and Labeling
The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table S1. Dynein
constructs were puriﬁed and labeled essentially as described previously
(Reck-Peterson et al., 2006). For modiﬁcations and details of the Lis1 and
Nudel puriﬁcations, see Extended Experimental Procedures. Protein concen-
trations were determined by comparisons with standards using Bradford
protein assays or SDS-PAGE with SYPRO Red (Invitrogen) staining. All protein
concentrations (dynein, Lis1, Nudel, and a/b-tubulin) are expressed for the
dimer, with the exception of Lis1DN, for which the monomer concentration is
given.

Single-Molecule Microscopy and ATPase Assays
Assays are described in detail
in the Extended Experimental Procedures.
Brieﬂy, motility assays were assembled using ﬂow chambers, and ﬂuores-
cently labeled dynein molecules and microtubules were visualized by TIRF
microscopy (Qiu et al., 2012; Reck-Peterson et al., 2006). Microtubule-
activated ATPase assays were performed using the EnzChek phosphatase
kit (Molecular Probes; Cho et al., 2008; Reck-Peterson et al., 2006).



Size-Exclusion Chromatography and EM
GST-dynein331 kDa (350–400 nM), Lis1 (700–800 nM), or a mixture of both
C under the indicated nucleotide
proteins was preincubated for 10 min at 4
conditions (200 mM Mg-ATP + 200 mM sodium vanadate, 200 mM Mg-ATP
alone, or no added nucleotide). Samples were fractionated on a Superose 6
PC 3.2/30 column equilibrated with buffer and nucleotide as required. For
negative-stain EM, peak fractions were stained with 1% uranyl formate and
imaged using a Tecnai G2 Spirit microscope, as detailed in the Extended
Experimental Procedures.
