Biophysical mechanism of T-cell receptor
triggering in a reconstituted system

John R. James1 & Ronald D. Vale1

A T-cell-mediated immune response is initiated by the T-cell receptor (TCR) interacting with peptide-bound major
histocompatibility complex (pMHC) on an infected cell. The mechanism by which this interaction triggers intracellular
phosphorylation of the TCR, which lacks a kinase domain, remains poorly understood. Here, we have introduced the
TCR and associated signalling molecules into a non-immune cell and reconstituted ligand-specific signalling when these
cells are conjugated with antigen-presenting cells. We show that signalling requires the differential segregation of a
phosphatase and kinase in the plasma membrane. An artificial, chemically controlled receptor system generates the
same effect as TCR–pMHC, demonstrating that the binding energy of an extracellular protein–protein interaction can
drive the spatial segregation of membrane proteins without a transmembrane conformational change. This general
mechanism may extend to other receptors that rely on extrinsic kinases, including, as we demonstrate, chimaeric
antigen receptors being developed for cancer immunotherapy.

In addition to intercellular communication mediated by soluble
molecules,
two cells can transmit signals through membrane-
associated receptors and ligands. Adaptive immunity represents such
a system, in which the MHC protein on the surface of antigen-
presenting cells (APCs) interacts with the TCR on T lymphocytes.
If the TCR binds pMHC of the right complementarity, the interaction
results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the TCR (herein referred to as
TCR ‘triggering’) and the initiation of signals that activate the T cell1.
The TCR has no intrinsic kinase activity, unlike many other receptors2,
and instead relies on a T-cell-specific kinase called Lck (ref. 3). Also
distinct from other systems, the phosphorylatable tyrosine residues of
the TCR (the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs
(ITAMs))4 do not reside on the polypeptides that contact the pMHC
(a, b) but instead are contained on tightly associated CD3 subunits
(c, d, e2, f2). The phosphorylated ITAMs then bind a second kinase,
ZAP70, which is subsequently activated and drives downstream
signalling5.

Despite considerable work, the mechanism by which pMHC bind-
ing leads to TCR triggering remains poorly understood (reviewed in
ref. 6). Some models propose that pMHC binding evokes a conforma-
tional change in the TCR that makes its cytoplasmic ITAM domains
more accessible to Lck kinase7. Alternative triggering hypotheses
include activation through the aggregation of TCR molecules6, and
‘kinetic segregation’8, where TCR phosphorylation is favoured by its
partitioning into plasma membrane domains that contain Lck kinase
but are depleted of CD45 (also known as PTPRC), an abundant
transmembrane phosphatase. However, although TCR clustering9
and the segregation of CD45 away from the TCR have been observed10,
it has not been established whether such events are necessary or
sufficient for signal transduction across the plasma membrane. In
addition, the physical basis of protein segregation within the plasma
membrane is unclear.

Reconstitution of a biological phenomenon with defined compo-
nents has proven to be a powerful means for dissecting molecular
mechanisms. We have made use of this approach by introducing
the genes encoding the TCR and other proteins required for regulat-
ing its phosphorylation into a non-immune cell and recapitulating

TCR triggering when this cell forms a conjugate with an APC. Because
each protein can be introduced separately and is genetically engineered,
this system has allowed us to test models of TCR triggering and the
roles of individual proteins in a manner that is difficult to achieve with
native T cells.

Reconstitution of regulated TCR triggering
We first sought to reconstitute Lck-mediated TCR phosphorylation in
a non-immune cell and then determine which factors are needed to
keep the TCR quiescent (Fig. 1a). As the basis of our reconstitution,
we expressed11 the complete set of protein chains of the 1G4 TCR
(ref. 12) in the plasma membrane of HEK cells (hereafter referred to as
HEK-1G4) (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1). The
expressed TCR complex did not show detectable phosphoryla-
tion (assayed by a phospho-specific antibody to the CD3f chain, an
essential TCR subunit required for signalling13,14) unless Lck and
ZAP70 were co-expressed (Fig. 1b). Lck kinase activity, as detected
by measuring levels of activating (Tyr 394) and inhibitory (Tyr 505)
phosphorylation3, seemed to be unaffected by the presence of the TCR
or ZAP70 (Fig. 1b). However, ZAP70 activity, as measured by
increased Tyr 493 phosphorylation5, was only detectable in the
presence of both Lck and the TCR (Fig. 1b), which is in agreement
with previous data suggesting that this kinase is inactive until it binds
to phosphorylated CD3f ITAMs15 (Fig. 1a). We confirmed the activity
of ZAP70 by demonstrating phosphorylation of co-expressed LAT,
its downstream substrate and critical adaptor protein for T-cell
signalling (Supplementary Fig. 2a).

To establish a quiescent system that could be activated by pMHC, we
next sought to restrain the kinase activity of Lck. CSK induces an
‘inactive’ conformation of Lck by phosphorylating its carboxy terminus
(Tyr 505) (ref. 16). However, co-expressing CSK and CSK-binding
protein (CBP, also known as PAG1), which localizes CSK to the plasma
membrane (Fig. 1a), was insufficient to repress Lck phosphorylation of
CD3f (Fig. 1c). CD45 is a tyrosine phosphatase that modulates T-cell
signalling in a complex manner by dephosphorylating the inhibitory
Tyr 505 and activating Tyr 394 of Lck (refs 17, 18) and the ITAM
tyrosines of the TCR (Fig. 1a). Co-expression of CD45 with Lck severely

diminished Lck-induced ZAP70 activation but only modestly
inhibited phosphorylation of the CD3f chain of the TCR (Fig. 1c).
However, simultaneous expression of CSK, CBP and CD45 considerably
reduced CD3f phosphorylation (Fig. 1c). This synergy depended on
CBP (Fig. 1c), indicating that membrane recruitment of CSK is
required for its potency. Thus, the two major activities known to
repress TCR phosphorylation in T cells are sufficient, when combined,
to keep the TCR in a quiescent state in this reconstituted cell system.
ZAP70 is normally cytosolic but binds to phosphorylated TCR
ITAMs. The translocation of ZAP70–green fluorescent protein
(GFP) from the cytosol to the plasma membrane therefore provides
a microscopy-based assay of TCR triggering. Indeed, Lck expression
in HEK-1G4 cells caused ZAP70–GFP to accumulate at the plasma
membrane (Fig. 1d, e), whereas co-expression of CSK, CBP and
CD45 delocalized ZAP70 to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1e). Furthermore,
ZAP70–GFP translocated rapidly to the plasma membrane upon
CD45 phosphatase inhibition by pervanadate (Fig. 1f and Supplemen-
tary Movie 1). Thus, this visual assay provides a dynamic readout of
TCR triggering.

Reconstitution of a T cell–APC conjugate
Having identified a minimal set of components that could be
expressed in HEK-1G4 cells to mimic the basal or ‘off’ state of their
T-cell counterpart, we next attempted to trigger signalling by having
the 1G4 TCR interact with its ligand, the MHC class-I complex bound

with a short peptide (ESO9V) (ref. 19) and expressed in the Raji B-cell
line as the APC (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Methods). Because HEKs
and Raji B cells have no intrinsic affinity for each other (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3a), we expressed the immune-cell adhesion proteins CD2
and ICAM1 on the HEK-1G4 cells (Fig. 2a), which can interact
with their respective counter-receptors CD58 and LFA-1 expressed
endogenously on Raji cells (Supplementary Fig. 1). This strongly
increased the conjugation between the two cell types, with the
LFA-1–ICAM1 interaction being the predominant driver (Sup-
plementary Fig. 3a).

We found that the HEK-1G4 cells formed a cup-shaped contact
around the APC expressing antigenic pMHC (Supplementary
Movie 2), which was notably similar to T cell–APC conjugates20.
pMHC was concentrated at the site of cell–cell interaction (Fig. 2b, c),
and importantly, ZAP70 in the HEK-1G4 cells translocated to the
plasma membrane in this region, showing that TCR triggering had
occurred (Fig. 2b–d; confirmed by immunoblotting in Supplementary
Fig. 2b). Triggering was rapid and could be observed within 1 min of cell
contact (Supplementary Movie 3). Membrane translocation of ZAP70
did not occur when HEK-1G4 cells were conjugated with Raji cells
expressing a control peptide–MHC complex (Fig. 2b, d) or in HEK-
1G4 cells lacking transfected Lck (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2b).
We also found that the ITAMs of CD3f were sufficient for ligand-
specific ZAP70 translocation by using a minimal TCR complex with
the intracellular sequences of CD3c, d and e truncated after the trans-
membrane domain (TCRExfInt, where ‘Ex’ denotes the extracellular
and transmembrane parts of the molecule and ‘Int’ denotes the intra-
cellular part; Fig. 2d). Although the APC used in these experiments
expressed the cognate pMHC at high levels (,50 pMHC per mm2),
ZAP70 recruitment was still observable at lower, more physiological,
levels of antigenic pMHC (,3 pMHC per mm2) (refs 21, 22)
(Supplementary Figs 1 and 4). In summary, an APC expressing the
appropriate pMHC is able to elicit a specific TCR-triggering response
from our reconstituted HEK-1G4 cell.

Disrupting the actin cytoskeleton severely inhibits T-cell activa-
tion23, but its role in TCR triggering is uncertain. Depolymerization
of actin filaments in HEK-1G4 cells before mixing with APCs signifi-
cantly decreased the number of conjugates (Supplementary Fig. 3b),
but cells that did interact still showed ZAP70 recruitment (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3c). This result indicates that the cytoskeleton facilitates the
initial cell–cell interactions but is not essential for TCR triggering in
this reconstituted cell system.

Mechanistic insight into how the TCR was triggered by pMHC
came from the observation that CD45 phosphatase was excluded from
the cell–cell interface where the TCR was bound to its cognate ligand
(Fig. 2b, c), whereas Lck remained included (Supplementary Fig. 5a).
As complete repression of Lck phosphorylation of the TCR required
CD45, CSK and CBP (Fig. 1c), the segregation of CD45 away from the
TCR would be predicted to shift the steady-state balance towards TCR
phosphorylation. Previous studies have also found that most CD45
molecules are excluded from the interface of real T cell–APC conju-
gates24,25 and could be involved in triggering26,27. However, it has been
difficult to ascertain whether CD45 exclusion is responsible for, or a
consequence of, TCR triggering. To show more definitively that CD45
exclusion has a causal role, we redirected phosphatase activity into the
cell–cell interface by fusing the intracellular phosphatase domains of
CD45 to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD2
(termed CD2ExCD45Int), because CD2 was localized within the con-
jugate interface (Supplementary Fig. 5b). The CD2ExCD45Int con-
struct was observed clearly within the interface, as expected
(Fig. 2e), and ZAP70 was no longer recruited to this region, indicating
that TCR triggering was abolished (Fig. 2d, e). This result shows that
CD45 exclusion is required for TCR triggering in our reconstituted
cell system.

To show that CD45 exclusion and TCR triggering were not
dependent on each other, we temporally separated the formation of
the signalling zone from TCR triggering by engineering a TCR lacking
its ITAMs but instead having an intracellular recruitment domain
(FKBP) (TCRExFKBPInt; Fig. 3a). We expected this receptor to localize
within the cell–cell interface through its extracellular interaction with
pMHC, but to be unable to recruit ZAP70 in the absence of any
signalling motifs. To initiate TCR phosphorylation and ZAP70
recruitment, an FKBP-binding domain (FRB) was fused to the cyto-
plasmic region of CD3f (FRB–CD3fInt), which can be induced to
dimerize with TCRExFKBPInt upon addition of the drug rapamycin
(Fig. 3a). CD45 and pMHC were excluded and concentrated from the

However, ZAP70 was recruited to the membrane in the zones of
CD45 exclusion only when the separated components of the TCR
(TCRExFKBPInt and FRB-CD3fInt) were brought together with rapa-
mycin (Fig. 3b, c). Time-lapse imaging showed no discernible delay
between the translocation of FRB–CD3fInt to the plasma membrane

The mechanism of CD45 segregation
We next wished to explore what forces produce CD45 exclusion. MHC
bound with a control peptide did not elicit CD45 segregation (Fig. 2b),
therefore the adhesion pairs (CD2–CD58 and LFA-1–ICAM1) must
be incapable of driving exclusion (Supplementary Fig. 5c). We next
tested the TCR–pMHC interaction alone, and found that it was
sufficient for conjugation (Supplementary Fig. 3a) and CD45 segrega-
tion (Fig. 4a). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and
fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) experiments showed that
the TCR remained mobile after pMHC binding and free to escape the
conjugated region, showing that the segregated zone was not formed by
an immobile aggregate and remained contiguous with the rest of the
cell surface (Supplementary Fig. 6). Thus, the TCR–pMHC interaction

apposition, as suggested by the kinetic-segregation model8. We tested
this hypothesis by fusing the intracellular phosphatase domains of
CD45 to an extracellular domain (from CD86) of comparable size
to the TCR (termed CD86ExCD45Int). CD86ExCD45Int was also
excluded from the cell–cell interface, although its exclusion (Fig. 4c)
and TCR triggering (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b) were somewhat lower
than that seen with the large CD45 construct (Fig. 4c). Because of this
unanticipated exclusion of a protein with a small extracellular
domain, we next tested mCherry fusion proteins of a series of
membrane proteins with different properties: CD58, a transmembrane
protein with an equivalently sized extracellular domain to CD86;
b2-adrenergic receptor (b2AR, also known as ADRB2), a seven-
transmembrane protein with small extracellular loops; and a
prenylated version of the fluorophore linked to the inner leaflet of
the bilayer by using a short targeting sequence (CAAX) (Fig. 4c).
CD58 was excluded to a similar level as CD86ExCD45Int, showing that
the segregation of the latter construct was not due to the intracellular
phosphatase domains of CD45 (Fig. 4c). b2AR, a protein with a
large lateral footprint, was also partially excluded (Fig. 4c), possibly
through a crowding effect arising from the high density of pMHC–
TCR in the conjugate region. However, the prenylated mCherry was
distributed evenly throughout the cell membrane, showing no exclu-
sion by TCR–pMHC (Fig. 4c).

The above experiments cannot explain why CD2 (Supplementary
Fig. 5b) and CD2ExCD45Int (Fig. 2e), which has extracellular domains
similar in size to CD86, were not excluded from the cell–cell contact
zone. We speculated that binding of CD2 to its ligand (CD58)
expressed endogenously on the APC provided a counteracting force
to constrain CD2 within the conjugate region. If this were true, then
expressing CD28, the binding partner for CD86, on the APC should
diminish the TCR–pMHC-mediated segregation of CD86ExCD45Int.
Indeed, when CD86ExCD45Int-expressing HEK-1G4 cells were con-
jugated with APCs co-expressing CD28, CD86ExCD45Int localized at
the cell–cell interface and TCR triggering was greatly decreased
(Supplementary Fig. 7b, c).

In summary, the TCR–pMHC interaction alone is capable of
excluding plasma membrane proteins with extracellular extensions
and that exclusion can be overcome by the energy provided by bind-
ing to a protein partner on the APC.

Triggering of artificial receptors
The preceding experiments suggested that TCR triggering results
from CD45 segregation, which is driven by the binding interaction
between the TCR and pMHC. If this is true, then interactions between
extracellular domains of membrane proteins with the proper spacing
and affinity might elicit comparable effects to TCR–pMHC, as has
been shown in T cells28. To explore this idea, we engineered a
chemically controlled, cell-surface-receptor system consisting of a
transmembrane protein with extracellular FKBP and the intracellular
CD3f ITAM domains expressed in the HEK cell (FKBPExfInt;
mimicking the TCR) and a transmembrane protein with an extra-
cellular FRB expressed in the APC (mimicking the pMHC) (Fig. 5a).
FKBPExfInt and FRBEx will only interact in the presence of rapamycin,
forming a complex that spans a similar distance to TCR–pMHC. In
the absence of rapamycin, conjugates formed (through the LFA-1–
ICAM1 interaction) but ZAP70 was not recruited to the membrane
(Fig. 5b, c). However, with rapamycin, FKBPExfInt receptor clusters
were observed at the cell–cell interface, even with low levels of FRBEx
ligand that are equivalent to physiological densities of antigen pMHC
(,5 molecules per mm2; Supplementary Fig. 1). Furthermore, CD45
was excluded from and ZAP70 was recruited to these receptor
clusters, indicating that triggering had occurred (Fig. 5b–d).

Our artificial receptor is structurally analogous to chimaeric
antigen receptors (CARs), which have an extracellular single-chain
antibody fragment fused to a transmembrane sequence and cytoplasmic
CD3f ITAMs. When the CD19-specific CAR (ref. 29), which has

is necessary and sufficient for CD45 exclusion, with no requirement for
downstream TCR triggering/signalling.

Next, we examined how the TCR–pMHC interaction affected the
spacing of the two plasma membranes of the interacting cells. Using a
subdiffraction-resolution method, we measured the separation
between a GFP-tagged TCR in the HEK cells and mCherry–pMHC
in the APC (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Methods). The measured
distance of ,31 nm (Fig. 4b) suggests a cell–cell separation of
,15 nm, which agrees well with the 13 nm cell-to-cell distance
between T cells and conjugated APCs measured by electron micro-
scopy (ref. 28). By contrast, the membrane separation for Raji cells
expressing control pMHC conjugated through adhesion molecules
alone (ICAM1–LFA-1 or ICAM1–LFA-1 and CD2–CD58) was much
greater (Fig. 4b). These results show that the TCR–pMHC interaction
brings the membranes much closer together than occurs with the
adhesion molecules.

shown promise in recent clinical trials as a gene therapy treatment of
leukaemia29, was expressed in our reconstituted HEK cells and these
cells were conjugated with Raji B cells (which are CD191), we observed
CAR clustering, ZAP70 recruitment and CD45 exclusion (Fig. 5e, f).
This triggering was ligand specific, as conjugation with CD192 cells
did not produce these effects (Fig. 5e, f). Interestingly, the interface of
many CD192CAR HEK cell and CD191 Raji B-cell conjugates
showed a highly convoluted membrane surface (Supplementary
Movie 5), which was not seen for cells interacting through either
TCR–pMHC or FKBPExfInt2FRBEx. This membrane effect could be
a product of high-affinity antibody binding and might warrant further
investigation for its relevance to CAR potency or potential side effects.

Conclusion
Our reconstitution experiments show a physical mechanism for TCR
triggering that differs from dimerization or conformational-change
models proposed for many cell-surface receptors. We find that the
binding energy of the TCR–pMHC interaction generates an exclusion
force for membrane proteins with large and/or unligated extracellular
domains, even in the absence of downstream signalling. By linking an
inhibitory phosphatase activity to a transmembrane protein (CD45)
that is subject to the exclusion force and an activating kinase (Lck) to
the inner leaflet of the membrane that is not, the TCR–pMHC inter-
action can shift the kinase–phosphatase balance and thus trigger the
TCR, as first suggested by the kinetic-segregation model8. Because the
FKBP–rapamycin–FRB or antibody–antigen modules can replace
the extracellular TCR–pMHC interaction, conformational changes
in the TCR are unlikely to be critical for the fundamental mechanism
of triggering. Co-receptors and actin also do not seem to be essential
for transducing TCR–pMHC binding across the plasma membrane,
although it is very probable that they are necessary for achieving the
high sensitivity and full selectivity of T-cell activation. This could be
tested in the future by pushing our reconstituted system to respond to
very low antigen densities using more sensitive read-outs of triggering.
The precise mechanism by which the TCR–pMHC interaction
results in protein exclusion remains elusive, although our data pro-
vide certain clues. Exclusion according to the kinetic-segregation
model is based on the greater size of the extracellular domain of
CD45 compared to the TCR–pMHC complex. However, although
size influences the extent of exclusion, our data show that membrane
proteins with small extracellular domains are also excluded, suggest-
ing that additional forces must be acting on the system. We speculate
upon the driving force in the following model, which incorporates
previous findings30–34. Within the initial adhesion mediated by
LFA-1–ICAM1 between the T cell and APC, transient fluctuations
bring the two membranes in closer apposition, allowing TCR and
pMHC molecules to interact (Fig. 6a). The binding energy of this
interaction must be sufficient to overcome unfavourable membrane
bending and compression of the large proteins that constitute the

Figure 6 | A model for steps in TCR-mediated segregation based on
membrane bending and energy minimization. The schematic uses
equivalent molecule representations to previous figures (only extracellular
domains are shown for simplicity) and boxed regions highlight features of each
panel. a, After initial adhesion driven by large receptors such as LFA-1,
transient fluctuations in the inter-membrane distance permit encounters
between TCR and pMHC; the binding interaction overcomes energetically

unfavourable membrane bending (red regions). b, Additional molecules (such
as CD2 and CD58) provide additional binding energy that stabilizes regions of
local membrane bending and may enhance the local exclusion of larger
molecules by TCR–pMHC interactions. c, Consolidation of discrete contact
regions serves to minimize unfavourable membrane bending and leads to the
exclusion of smaller proteins that do not provide any countering ligand-
binding free energy. See text for details.

glycocalyx, such as CD45, which occur when the two membranes
regions are brought close together (Fig. 6b). In a critical next step,
separate regions of close membrane apposition consolidate passively
into larger, contiguous regions, resulting in a net decrease in
membrane bending, as has been previously suggested35. Proteins that
do not provide any binding energy will be excluded over time,
because, as they diffuse from the region, interacting molecules will
be further clustered as the area of close apposition is minimized
(Fig. 6c). These same principles may explain how TCR microdomains
initiate when T cells interact with pMHC on a supported lipid
bilayer36–38 (note the small exclusion zones in our experiments at
low ligand densities (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 4)).

Overall, our data suggest how the binding energy associated with
specific molecular recognition events that take place between two
interacting cells can be transduced into intracellular biochemical
reactions that change cell behaviour. This model provides a plausible
mechanism to explain how CARs trigger T cells to kill cancerous
cells29 and may apply to other cell types that signal using membrane-
bound receptors and ligands.

METHODS SUMMARY
Multiple proteins were expressed in HEK cells using a combination of transient and
stable expression by lentiviral transduction; proteins were expressed at close to
physiological levels and in the correct localization as described in Supplementary
Methods. To create cell conjugates, the two cell types were centrifuged, resuspended
at high density and placed on glass-bottomed dishes for live-cell imaging at 37 uC
using spinning disc confocal microscopy. Image analysis, including the inter-
membrane distance algorithm, was performed using ImageJ and Matlab
(Supplementary Methods). Full methods and supplementary material accompany
this paper.
