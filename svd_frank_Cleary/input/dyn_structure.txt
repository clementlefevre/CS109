Insights into dynein motor domain function from a 3.3-Å 
crystal structure
Helgo Schmidt, Emma S Gleave & Andrew P Carter

Dyneins power the beating of cilia and flagella, transport various intracellular cargos and are necessary for mitosis. all 
dyneins have a ~300-kDa motor domain consisting of a ring of six aaa+ domains. atP hydrolysis in the aaa+ ring drives 
the cyclic relocation of a motile element, the linker domain, to generate the force necessary for movement. How the 
linker interacts with the ring during the atP hydrolysis cycle is not known. Here we present a 3.3-Å crystal structure of 
the motor domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytoplasmic dynein, crystallized in the absence of nucleotides. the linker 
is docked to a conserved site on aaa5, which is confirmed by mutagenesis as functionally necessary. nucleotide soaking 
experiments show that the main atP hydrolysis site in dynein (aaa1) is in a low-nucleotide affinity conformation and 
reveal the nucleotide interactions of the other three sites (aaa2, aaa3 and aaa4).

Dyneins are a family of motor proteins that use the energy of ATP 
hydrolysis to move along microtubules. Axonemal dyneins power the 
beating of cilia and flagella. Intraflagellar transport (IFT) dynein is 
necessary for axoneme biogenesis. Cytoplasmic dynein is involved with 
a wide array of cellular processes, from regulating the spindle assembly 
checkpoint and transport of organelles to localization of RNAs and 
gathering up of misfolded proteins1. Dyneins are also associated with 
a number of disease processes, including viral transport2, failure of 
neuron migration in lissencephaly1, and axonemal disorders such as 
primary ciliary dyskinesia3 and neurodegeneration4.

All dyneins share a conserved motor domain, whose overall organi-
zation has been revealed by EM5,6 and, more recently, low- resolution 
X-ray crystallography studies7,8 (Fig. 1a). The motor domain consists 
of a ring of six ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities 
(AAA+) domains9. Each AAA+ domain can be subdivided into an ab 
or ‘large’ (AAAL) subdomain and a five-helix bundle or ‘small’ sub-
domain (AAAS). All six AAA+ domains (AAA1–AAA6) are linked 
together in one polypeptide (Fig. 1a). AAA1 is the main hydrolysis 
site of the dynein motor domain10–12, but the role of nucleotide bind-
ing at three other sites (AAA2–AAA4) is unclear11–13. In addition 
to the AAA+ ring, other structures allow dynein to act as a motor. 
The microtubule binding domain (MTBD) is at the end of a 15-nm 
stalk made up of an antiparallel coiled coil emanating from AAA4S. 
The base of the stalk is reinforced by a coiled coil extension from 
AAA5S called the buttress (or strut8), which is likely to couple ATP 
binding to altered microtubule affinities of the MTBD7. To move the 
motor along microtubules, force is generated by ATP hydrolysis at 
AAA1, driving the cyclic relocation of a motile element called the 
linker. Upon ATP binding, the linker exits the ring closer to AAA2 
(pre–power stroke position), whereas in the absence of nucleotide 

or in the presence of ADP, it moves to exit the ring close to the base 
of the stalk (post–power stroke position)5,6,11.

Despite recent advances in our knowledge of dynein structure7,8, little 
is known about how ATP hydrolysis is coupled to the generation of 
force in dynein. Are there defined docking sites for the linker in the 
pre- and post–power stroke conformations, and if so, what do they look 
like? Is the linker in the same position in the nucleotide-free (apo) and 
ADP-bound forms of the motor, and how is ATP turnover at AAA1 
connected to changes in the position of the linker? Also, compared to 
AAA1, the roles of the other ATPase domains (AAA2–AAA4) are less 
clear, as there is contradictory evidence on whether one13–15 or two16,17 
ATPs are hydrolyzed per dynein step. In addition, mutations in these 
sites reduce but do not abolish dynein motility11–13, raising the question 
of what function they might have during the dynein mechanochemical 
cycle. Here we present the  high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of a 
dynein motor domain and provide insights into these questions.

results
structure determination
To solve the dynein motor domain at 3.3 Å, we used an under-oil batch 
crystallization method to improve the diffraction and reproducibility 
of crystals grown using a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-dimerized 
dynein motor domain construct with a truncated stalk (GST-Dyn1-
314kDD3039-3291)7.  The  related  construct  (GST-Dyn1-314kD), 
 containing a full-length stalk, walks normally along the microtubule, 
with velocities comparable to those of wild-type yeast dynein14. The 
 truncated-stalk version shows ATPase activity (22.1 µM Pi s–1 µM–1 
dimer)  and  undergoes  ATP-dependent  vanadate-mediated  UV 
 cleavage10 (Supplementary Fig. 1) in AAA1, showing that the main 
dynein site of hydrolysis responds to nucleotide. These experiments

indicate that the construct is an active ATPase, and they can thus  provide 
 important insights into the dynein ATPase cycle.

We  obtained  phases  by  collecting  SAD  datasets  from  LuAc  and 
Na2WO4 derivatives. Several rounds of multicrystal averaging, phase 
extension and model building were used to produce maps of sufficient 
quality to build a model that could be refined against a non–nucleotide-
soaked dataset (LuAc) and against datasets from crystals soaked with 
different nucleotides (Table 1). The finished structure (Fig. 1b) reveals 
a wealth of new data compared to a previous low-resolution structure 
(PDB 3QMZ)7. It is at a high enough resolution to build side chains 
and nucleotides (Supplementary Fig. 2a–f) and previously unseen loop 
regions, including the long connector peptides that link AAA+ domains 
together (Supplementary Fig. 2g,h).

interaction of the linker with the aaa+ ring
The linker is divided into four subdomains (Fig. 2a). The N-terminal 
subdomain 1 contacts AAA5L, and subdomain 2 spans over the pore 
of the AAA+ ring. The C-terminal subdomains 3 and 4 interact with 
AAA1L through extensive contacts, suggesting the linker is tightly 
connected to the AAA+ ring at this point. The middle of the linker 
consists of the junction between subdomains 2 and 3. Notably, unlike 
the rest of the linker, where there are multiple interactions between

(Fig. 2b) with only a single helix at its base.

The contact site between subdomain 1 and AAA5L consists of a hydro-
phobic pocket on subdomain 1 that accommodates a phenylalanine 
(Phe3446) on AAA5L, as well as a number of surrounding electrostatic 
interactions (Fig. 2c). To directly test the functional relevance of this site, 
we mutated Phe3446 and the surrounding residues in the  background of a 
GST-dimerized, truncated dynein motor construct (GST-Dyn1-331kD), 
which moves similarly to full-length native dynein14. The mutations 
resulted in severe motility defects (Fig. 2d), abnormally strong micro-
tubule binding states and impaired ATPase activities (Supplementary

the  mutated  residues  among  cytoplasmic  dyneins  (Fig.  3a–c),  
are consistent with the notion that linker binding to the AAA5 site is 
required for the dynein ATP hydrolysis cycle.

In addition to the AAA5L site, patches enriched in conserved residues 
also exist at AAA1L and two β-hairpins of AAA2 (Fig. 3a,b,d,e). The two

600 measurements were carried out, and 400 measurements were done for 
each of the mutants; error bars represent the s.d. More severe mutation of 
the linker-AAA5 interface leads to a greater reduction in velocity.

β-hairpins are close to a conserved patch on the linker found at the cleft 
between subdomains 2 and 3 (arrowheads in Figs. 2c and 3d,e). The 
AAA2 site forms the only highly conserved patch on the AAA+ ring not 
contacting the linker (Fig. 3a,b), which implies it might do so at some 
point of the mechanochemical cycle and that the linker therefore switches 
between two alternate ring docking sites during the power stroke.

catalysis. The adenine base binding pocket is between the large and small 
domains, and further contacts to the ATP phosphate groups are made 
by conserved arginine residues on the small domain (sensor 2) and the 
neighboring large domain (arginine finger) (Fig. 4a). Work on other 
oligomeric AAA+ domains has shown that nucleotide binding closes 
the gap between the second and first large domain, either partially— 
typically in the presence of ADP—or completely, to bring the arginine 
finger into contact with the nucleotide18–20.

In order to investigate nucleotide binding to the different AAA+ 
domains in dynein, we soaked crystals in ATP, ADP or AMP-PNP (Fig. 4b).  
Compared to the non–nucleotide soaked crystal structure, there are no 
major conformational changes. However, differences between the abili-
ties of the nucleotides to bind individual AAA+ domains have emerged.
The AAA1 site (AAA1-AAA2 interface) is devoid of nucleotide in all 
of our structures (Fig. 4b), and the phosphate-binding Walker A P-loop 
on AAA1L is instead occupied by a sulfate ion (Supplementary Fig. 4a). 
The AAA1 site is in a very open conformation compared to the other 
nucleotide binding sites (Supplementary Fig. 4a–d). It is over 10-Å 
wide at the bottom and nearly 20-Å wide at the top. That nucleotide 
binding does not occur, even though all sites are accessible and AAA3 
and AAA4 are occupied, demonstrates that the AAA1 site has a very low 
affinity for nucleotide in the conformation of dynein in our crystals. The 
reason for this low affinity is that the AAA1 small domain has swung 

down (Supplementary Fig. 4e,f) opening up the adenine base binding 
pocket so that the base would be more exposed to solvent than in the 
other nucleotide binding sites (Supplementary Fig. 4g–h). In addition, 
the small domain movement shifts the sensor 2 arginine residue so that 
it cannot contact the nucleotide  phosphate groups (Fig. 4c).

The  AAA2  site  (AAA2-AAA3  interface)  contains  density  for  a 
Mg-ATP molecule even when crystals were not soaked in nucleotide, 
showing that it is tightly bound (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 4b). 
AAA2 lacks the catalytic glutamate in the Walker B motif. The position 
of this glutamate is occupied by a conserved arginine (Arg2549) from 
AAA3, which reaches over to contact the Walker B aspartate (Asp2155) 
and helps anchor the ATP in place (Fig. 4d). The nucleotide is also con-
tacted by the arginine finger (Arg2552) from AAA3 and so adds to an 
extensive network of salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions that hold 
the AAA2 and AAA3 large domains together. Thus, the site is tightly 
closed and appears unlikely to open at any stage of the catalytic cycle.

The AAA3 nucleotide binding site (AAA3-AAA4 interface) contains 
all the nucleotide binding residues expected for an active AAA+ domain, 
arranged in the correct orientation (Fig. 4e). The AAA3 site is empty 
in the non–nucleotide soaked structure but is occupied in the presence 
of ATP, ADP and AMP-PNP (Fig. 4b). The nucleotide is more acces-
sible than in the AAA2 site (61Å2 of the nucleotide is solvent accessible 
 compared to 44 Å2 in the AAA2 site; see Supplementary Fig. 4b,c),

which is consistent with the AAA3 site having an intermediate nucleotide 
affinity. The adenine fits into the base binding pocket (Supplementary  
Fig. 4h) and packs against a methionine residue (Met2426), which moves 
in to make contact with it (Fig. 4e). The small domain of AAA3 makes 
contact with the nucleotide ribose from a conserved threonine residue 
(Thr2623) and with the nucleotide phosphate groups from the sensor 
arginine (Arg2620). The AAA3 site is in a semi-closed conformation 
(Supplementary Fig. 4c), similarly to other AAA+ proteins in their ADP 
state. The arginine finger from AAA4L (Arg2911) is still over 4.5 Å away 
from the nearest phosphate group, which suggests that the AAA3 site will 
close further in order for this residue to contact the nucleotide.

In the case of the AAA4 site (AAA4-AAA5 interface), only ADP soaks 
led to clear nucleotide binding (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 4d). 
The AAA4 site shows a number of unusual features in our structure. The 
proposed catalytic glutamate (Glu2819) is angled away from the nucleo-
tide by the presence of a short a-helix (Fig. 4f), suggesting it is unable to 
catalyze ATP hydrolysis. The relative position of the two large domains 
is reminiscent of a fully closed nucleotide binding site, with the arginine 
finger (Arg3512) in position to contact the nucleotide. Despite the fact 
that the relative orientation of the large domains is similar to that of the 
AAA2 site, the nucleotide is not tightly buried (an 84-Å2 area is solvent 
accessible; see Supplementary Fig. 4d). This is due to the exposure of 
the phosphate and ribose groups, as the base is buried to a similar extent 
as the nucleotide in AAA3 (Supplementary Fig. 4h,i). The positions of 
the large domains are stabilized in part by an arginine residue (Arg2763) 
located within the AAA4 Walker A P-loop, forming a hydrogen bond 
with helix 4 of AAA5L and a salt bridge with AAA4S (Fig. 4f).

Discussion
During the dynein mechanochemical cycle, ATP binding and hydro-
lysis at AAA1 drives the linker into a pre–power stroke position close to 
AAA2 (refs. 5,11), whereas phosphate release allows return to the post–
power stroke conformation. After the power stroke, ADP is released to 
reach the nucleotide-free (apo) state before ATP rebinding occurs11. Our 
structure was crystallized in the absence of nucleotide, and the linker is 
in a post–power stroke position, with its N terminus near the base of the 
stalk, suggesting it resembles the final, apo state of the dynein ATP cycle.
Both copies of the motor domain in the GST-dimerized construct 
are in a similar conformation (mean r.m.s. deviation is 1.3 Å), despite 
making different crystal packing contacts (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b), 
which indicates that crystallization doesn’t distort the motor domain. 
Furthermore, the conserved nature of the AAA5 linker-binding site, 
together with our mutagenesis data, suggest that the post–power stroke 
state we observe is relevant to understanding the dynein ATPase cycle.
The low affinity of AAA1 for nucleotide in our structure is most likely 
due to the movement of the small domain, which both removes the sen-
sor arginine and opens up the base binding pocket. The presence of low-
affinity nucleotide binding sites is a known feature of AAA+ proteins, 
and  it  has  been  demonstrated  structurally20,21  and  biochemically22. 
In the AAA+ family member ClpX, movement of the small domain is 
also responsible for the low-affinity nucleotide binding site, although in 
this case it is rotated in to sterically block access to the adenine binding 
pocket20. The large changes between low-affinity and nucleotide-bound 
states in AAA+ proteins are almost certainly incompatible with the crys-
talline state of the dynein motor domain, which explains why we could 
not observe nucleotide binding to AAA1 in our structure. Notably, crystals 
of the low-nucleotide affinity (rigor) conformation of myosin, a motor 
protein unrelated to the AAA+ family, can bind nucleotide when soaked 
with ADP23. However, in this case, the adenine base pocket is always fully 
established, so in contrast to the dynein AAA1 site, rigor myosin requires 
much smaller conformational changes for nucleotide binding.

Figure 5  Schematic representation of the nucleotide-free dynein motor 
domain. The linker is in a post–power stroke position conformation and 
interacts with the AAA+ through conserved surface patches on AAA5 and 
AAA1. Conserved amino acid residues on the b-hairpins of AAA2 are in close 
proximity to a similarly conserved region near the linker cleft. A nucleotide-
induced gap closure of the AAA1 site may bring these two areas into contact. 
The linker, in interacting with AAA5 and AAA1 at the same time, might act 
as a spacer pushing apart the two halves of the motor domain (light and dark 
gray) and causing a gap to open between AAA1-AAA2 and AAA5-AAA6. The 
gap at AAA1 leads to a low-nucleotide affinity state for this site. The AAA2 
site contains a tightly bound ATP and is likely to have a purely structural role. 
Sites AAA3 and AAA4 appear to adopt a semi-closed conformation and can 
bind and release nucleotide. Although the AAA3 ATP hydrolysis site seems to 
be in a catalytically competent conformation, crucial catalytic residues of the 
AAA4 site might not be able to support ATP hydrolysis. The circled numbers 
indicate the location of AAA+ domains.

The recent low-resolution structure of a Dictyostelium discoideum 
dynein motor domain, crystallized in the presence of ADP (PDB 3AY1)8, 
also has its linker in a post–power stroke conformation but with the  
N terminus of the linker closer to AAA4 and not making contact with 
the AAA5 site. A comparison of the D. discoideum and yeast structures 
suggests there are two different post–power stroke conformations of 
dynein. It is possible that the presence or absence of ADP is respon-
sible for the differences in linker position or, in other words, that the 
interaction of the linker with AAA5 is associated with ejection of the 
nucleotide. Previous work did not consider the possibility of multiple 
post–power stroke conformations, but this may be because the differ-
ence in the linker positions is too small to be detected by the FRET11,16,24 
and negative-stain EM techniques that were used6.

The gaps between AAA1L-AAA2L and AAA5L-AAA6L7 appear to 
divide the AAA+ ring into two halves. We propose that the linker, when 
bound to AAA5L, acts as a spacer that pushes apart these two halves and 
opens up the AAA1 site to create a low-nucleotide affinity state. The result 
is an asymmetrical, non-planar overall conformation for the AAA+ ring. 
Consistent with this interpretation, the AAA+ ring in the D. discoideum 
crystal structure8, where the linker does not contact AAA5L, shows a more 
symmetrical and planar arrangement of its building units. The effect of the 
AAA5L site mutations may thus be explained by a reduction in the ability 
of the motor domain to enter a low-affinity AAA1 site, so that the motor 
becomes trapped with nucleotide in its main hydrolysis site. Notably, 
the  AAA5L  site  residues  (Lys3438,  Arg3445  and  Phe3446)  are  very 
highly conserved only in cytoplasmic dyneins. In the IFT and inner-arm

suggesting they also use the AAA5 site for docking the linker to the ring. 
In the outer-arm dyneins, this site is not well conserved (Fig. 3c), so these 
motors may use a different strategy to release nucleotide from AAA1.

An important question is how the N terminus of the linker moves 
to its pre–power stroke state, exiting the ring near AAA2 (ref. 6). Our 
structure shows a conserved site on AAA2 that consists of a pair of 
b-hairpins. This site is adjacent to a conserved patch on the underside 
of the linker at the base of a hinge-like cleft. Modeling of the closed 
AAA1 conformation, based on the ATP-bound crystal structure of the 
AAA+ protein NtrC, suggests these two sites come into direct contact 
upon binding ATP (Supplementary Fig. 5c–e). We therefore propose 
that nucleotide binding detaches the linker from AAA5 and allows it to 
attach through a different site to AAA2. How this interaction results in 
the change in linker position observed by EM and whether it is causing 
the linker to bend at the hinge-like cleft are fascinating questions, but 
these will require further studies to elucidate.

Dyneins are unusual among motor proteins in having multiple nucleo-
tide binding10 sites. The mutagenesis of residues at AAA2, AAA3 and  
AAA4 leads to a decrease in velocity12,13 but does not allow us to dis-
tinguish between structural, regulatory or catalytic roles. Our structure 
now builds on this work to provide further insight into the roles of these 
additional nucleotide binding sites. Our structure shows that the AAA3 
site contains all the residues of an active AAA+ site, suggesting that it 
can hydrolyze ATP. However, these residues are not all conserved in 
axonemal and IFT dyneins. Furthermore, although mutagenesis of the 
Walker B catalytic glutamate impaired dynein velocity, it did not com-
pletely abrogate it, in contrast to the equivalent mutation at AAA1. The 
conformational changes in the AAA3 cleft must in some way contribute 
to the catalytic cycle, without being essential. The tightly bound nucleo-
tide at AAA2 suggests it has a purely structural role and that mutations 
at this site act by disrupting the rigid AAA2-AAA3 interface and hence 
interfering with communication between AAA1 and AAA3.

In our structure, the AAA4 site appears to be in an inactive conformation. 
However, mutagenesis of the Walker A motif in AAA1 allows UV-mediated 
vanadate cleavage to occur at AAA4 (ref. 12), implying that the conforma-
tion of AAA4 may respond to events at AAA1. Therefore, we cannot rule 
out a conformational rearrangement that activates the AAA4 site at other 
points of dynein’s catalytic cycle. It is notable, however, that the Walker B 
motif in AAA4 is not well conserved in IFT and axonemal dyneins, and 
mutation in cytoplasmic dyneins has no effect on velocity13. This suggests 
that whatever the role of AAA4, it is not required in all dyneins.

The main features of dynein revealed by our structure are summarized 
in Figure 5. In the absence of nucleotide, the linker spans the AAA+ 
ring contacting conserved patches at AAA5 and AAA1. The AAA1 
site is wide open and has a low affinity for nucleotide. AAA2 binds 
nucleotide tightly and has a structural role. AAA3 appears active for 
ATP hydrolysis, whereas in this conformation, AAA4 does not. There 
is a cluster of conserved residues on AAA2 that is directly adjacent to a 
conserved patch on the underside of the linker at the base of a cleft. This 
may represent another interaction site with the linker. ATP binding to 
AAA1 would require closure of the gap between AAA1 and AAA2 and 
could bring these two conserved sites into proximity with each other.

Crystallization constructs. Crystals were produced with construct GST-Dyn1-
314kDD3039-3291, which is identical to the previously reported construct7, that lacks 
the MTBD and has a truncated stalk region fused with the peptide PKAPPEEKEA. 
Crystals were also obtained with the construct GST-Dyn1-314kDD3039-3289 that 
was produced by modifying GST-Dyn1-314kDD3039-3291. The truncated stalk 
region in this case was fused with the peptide Gly-Asp. All genomic manipula-
tions were carried out using standard molecular biology techniques.

Crystallization  and  data  collection.  Crystals  of  constructs  GST-Dyn1-
314kDD3039-3291  or  Dyn1-Dyn1-314kDD3039-3289  were  obtained  by  under-oil 
batch crystallization. A 3-µl aliquot of protein solution (6–15 mg ml–1 in 20 mM 
Tris-HCl 8.0, 100 mM KAc, 2 mM MgAc, 1 mM EGTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol and 
1 mM DTT) was mixed with an equal amount of seeding solution produced 
from crystals that were resuspended in 12% (v/v) PEG3350, 100 mM sodium 
citrate, pH 5.7, and 200 mM ammonium sulfate and covered with 10 µl of Al’s 
Oil (Hampton Research). The crystals for the seeding solution were produced 
with methods described previously7. Crystallization using the under-oil batch 
approach was carried out at 4 °C, and crystals grew to a maximal dimension of 0.8 
× 0.4 × 0.2 mm3. To obtain LuAc-derivatives, crystals were soaked overnight in 
solutions consisting of 5 mM LuAc, 100 mM Tris-HCl 7.5, 200 mM ammonium 
sulfate, 20% (v/v) PEG3350 and 15% (v/v) glycerol. We also tried to obtain LuAc-
derivatives by co-crystallization trials in the presence of 1 mM LuAc, followed by 
quick soaking in cryoprotectant (100 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.7, 200 mM ammo-
nium sulfate, 20% (v/v) PEG3350 and 15–20% (v/v) glycerol).  However, in the 
later stages of data analysis, successful derivatization could not be detected, and 
we refer to this dataset as ‘native’. WO4-derivatization was carried out by transfer-
ring crystals into solutions containing 20 mM Na2WO4, 100 mM Tris-HCl 7.0, 
200 mM ammonium sulfate, 20% (v/v) PEG3350 and 15% (v/v) glycerol for 4 
h. The LuAc dataset originated from LuAc soaking experiments, and in terms 
of nucleotide binding we refer to this dataset as ‘unsoaked’ or ‘non–nucleotide 
soaked’. The ADP-complex was produced by soaking crystals in 20 mM ADP, 100 
mM sodium citrate, pH 5.7, 200 mM ammonium sulfate, 20% (v/v) PEG3350 
and 20% (v/v) glycerol for 15 h. An alternative soaking condition also included 
2 mM MgCl2. However, both conditions produced similar results in terms of 
ligand binding. The ATP and AMP-PNP complexes were obtained by transfer-
ring crystals for 12 h into solutions consisting of 100 mM Tris-HCl 8.0, 200 mM 
ammonium sulfate, 20% (v/v) PEG3350, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM MgAc and 10 
mM ATP or AMP-PNP, respectively. Using higher MgCl2 and ATP concentra-
tions (25 mM) in the soaking experiments did not substantially change the results 
in terms of ligand binding. The crystals used for the ADP and Na2WO4 soaking 
experiments were obtained with construct GST-Dyn1-314kDΔ3039-3289; all other 
crystals were obtained with construct GST-Dyn1-314kDΔ3039-3291. Crystals were 
directly plunge-frozen in liquid nitrogen before data collection. SAD data on the 
LuAc and Na2WO4 derivatives were collected at 100 K on beamline I02 at the 
Diamond Light source at a wavelength of 1.3408 Å or 1.21471 Å, respectively, 
and data collections on the nucleotide-soaked crystals were carried out at the 
European Synchrotron Radiation Facility or at the Diamond Light source. All 
datasets collected from single or multiple crystals were integrated and scaled 
using HKL2000 (ref. 25), XDS26 or MOSFLM27 and AIMLESS28.

Structure  determination.  The  location  of  heavy  atom  positions  was  deter-
mined from anomalous difference Fourier electron density maps calculated 
with FFT29, using phases obtained by molecular replacement using PHASER30, 
with the recently published low-resolution structure as a search model7. The 
derivative data along with the respective heavy atom positions were fed into the 
AutoSol wizard of PHENIX31, using the SAD approach to produce experimen-
tally phased electron density maps. The overall figures of merit after heavy atom 
phasing for the LuAc and Na2WO4 derivatives were 0.30 and 0.37, respectively. 

In addition, the native dataset was combined with previously obtained W12-
cluster low-resolution phases7. The quality of electron density maps calculated 
from the native dataset was improved in combination with the derivative data 
using multicrystal averaging and phase extension in DMMULTI32, which allowed 
for manual model building in Coot33. This preliminary model was used in a 
molecular- replacement approach for the dataset obtained from the ADP-soaked 
crystals, using PHASER30. The low-resolution data of the latter approach were 
incorporated in the multicrystal-averaging procedure described above to obtain 
an updated model. Further improvements were achieved by iterative rounds of 
refinement with REFMAC34 or CNS35 against the ADP-dataset, and manual 
rebuilding in Coot33. This final model was used as a search template in molecular 
replacement approaches with PHASER30 against the datasets obtained from the 
ATP- and AMP-PNP–soaked crystals as well as from the LuAc derivative. The 
obtained models were updated by iterative rounds of refinement in REFMAC34 
and manual rebuilding in Coot33. The data and refinement statistics are sum-
marized in Table 1. Figures were prepared using PYMOL (http://www.pymol.
org). Alignments were carried out with CEALIGN36, and surface area calculations 
were done with AREAIMOL29 or SURFACE29.

ATP-vanadate–mediated UV cleavage. A 10-µl portion of purified GST-Dyn1-
314kD or GST-Dyn1-314kDD3039-3291 (2–6 mg ml–1) was diluted into 38 µL of 
buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM KAc, 5 mM MgAc, 1 mM DTT), followed 
by the addition of 1 µl of ATP-Mg (100 mM) and 1 µl of sodium orthovanadate 
(100 mM) solution. The sodium orthovanadate was incubated at 95 °C for 10 min 
before using. The samples were incubated on ice for 30 min then UV-irradiated 
for another 60 min and subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

Microtubule binding assay. Protein and microtubules were mixed and incu-
bated with and without 10 mM ATP. The samples were centrifuged at 265,000g 
for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted, and the pellet was suspended in 
 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM KAc, 2 mM MgAc, 1 mM EGTA, 
10% (v/v)  glycerol, 1 mM DTT and 10 µM taxol) to a volume equal to that of the 
 supernatant. Input, supernatant and pellet samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

Motility and ATPase assays. The motility and ATPase assays were carried out 
as described14
