The apartment itself is not that big, however it will do for around 6 people.

We were quite a big group staying at the apt and he made us all feel very welcome. The location was absolutely fantastic very close to the center a few mins walk from the U- bahn and S- bahn which made getting around Berlin a lot easier. Definitely recommending this place to bigger groups, we had a reunion and the common area was a great advantage of this place.","id":35301971,"localized_date":"June 2015","response":"","review_vote":{"downvote_count":null,"has_upvoted":false,"listing_id":4106583,"review_id":35301971,"upvote_count":null},"reviewee":{"first_name":"Alex","host_name":"Alex","id":20998252,"is_superhost":false,"last_name":"prune_me","picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/20998252/profile_pic/1410851791/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/20998252","profile_pic_path":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/20998252/profile_pic/1410851791/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium"},"reviewer":{"first_name":"Maria","host_name":"Maria","id":20981170,"is_superhost":false,"last_name":"prune_me","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/20981170/profile_pic/1436745491/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/20981170","profile_pic_path":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/20981170/profile_pic/1436745491/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium"}},{"comments":"Alex's place was easy to find and convenient located at Wedding S-Bahn and U-bahn. The rooms were clean and cosy, we had a good night's rest. He was also nice enough to come by to open the gate, to allow us to drop out suitcases off in the hall earlier than the check-in time. The only downside was the toilet which was small but that wasn't much of a problem either. Overall a very wonderful stay at this uniquely decorated apartment!
