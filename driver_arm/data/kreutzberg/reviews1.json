Sharing the kitchen was no problem, there is more than enough privacy. Because there are so many shops and restaurants around te corner, we actually did not use the kitchen that much. We were with 5 girls, so we used all the beds and they were all very comfortable. The room was really cosy, from the moment we came in it felt like our home for the weekend.

It's a lot shabbier in reality. The apartment was rather filthy, there was hair in one bed, the bed sheets had stains on them and the toilet was dirty. The freezing compartment in the fridge in the living room leaked a milk-like substance that we had to keep mopping up, and it smelled rather badly. We obviously can't tell if that is the host's or the previous guest's fault, but the host could have fixed that before someone else rented the apartment (and he could have cleaned it, as well). The shower head in the bathroom was not attachable, so you had to hold it in your hand while showering. The bathroom doesn't have a towel rail or hook. The light in the small bedroom only works when the light is on in the living room at the same time, which is annoying when one person wants to sleep and another still wants to read or do something else. Recently a new door was installed where you can still see the remnants of the construction such as styrofoam and some debris. Which isn't too much of a nuisance, but it gives the place an uncomfortable feel to it. And of course it is hidden well in the pictures. We did not meet the host personally. Not too bothersome, but a little impersonal. Altogether the apartment makes a shabby and rather filthy impression, and for that price there are certainly better apartments available in Berlin. Das Appartement entsprach leider nicht den Erwartungen, die man anhand der Bilder vorher hatte. Es sieht in echt deutlich schäbiger aus. Die Hygiene ließ zu wünschen übrig. Es waren Haare im Bett aufzufinden, der Bettbezug war fleckig und das Klo schmutzig. Aus dem Kühlschrank im Wohnzimmer lief eine merkwürdige milchige Flüssigkeit aus dem Eisfach, welche unangenehm roch und wir immer wieder aufwischen mussten. Ob hierfür der Gastgeber oder der Vermieter verantwortlich war, ist natürlich nicht auszumachen, jedoch hätte der dieses Ärgernis vorher beheben können. Der Duschkopf im Bad war nicht anbringbar, somit musste man beim Duschen stets mit einer Hand den Duschkopf halten. Das Bad hat keinen Haken oder eine Halterung für Handtücher. Das Licht im kleinen Schlafzimmer funktioniert nur, wenn im Wohnzimmer gleichzeitig das Licht an ist. Nervig, wenn eine Person bereits schlafen, jemand anders jedoch noch lesen oder etwas anderes im Nebenraum tun möchte. Kürzlich wurde eine neue Tür zum Wohnzimmer eingebaut, vorher war dort eine deutlich größere, die Umrisse sind davon noch zu sehen und Schaumstoff, Styropor und Schuttreste sind noch am Türrahmen. An sich nicht sonderlich schlimm, jedoch macht es die Wohnung gleich auf den ersten Eindruck etwas ungemütlich. Und auf den Bildern wird das natürlich geschickt versteckt.

The apt is very well located - subway is just 5 minutes walk and lots of nice bars in the sorroundings. The apt is very well confortable, no problem at all with sharing kitchen. \r\nAlex has been an excellent host from the beginning. Even if he couldn't meet us, he managed to make it possible for us to get the keys. Also, he let us to store our luggage until the afternoon. \r\nHope to stay again at his place in my next trip to Berlin :) ","id":36395593,"localized_date":"June 2015","response":"","review_vote":{"downvote_count":null,"has_upvoted":false,"listing_id":5322843,"review_id":36395593,"upvote_count":null},"reviewee":{"first_name":"Alex","host_name":"Alex","id":20998252,"is_superhost":false,"last_name":"prune_me","picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/20998252/profile_pic/1410851791/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/20998252","profile_pic_path":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/20998252/profile_pic/1410851791/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium"},"reviewer":{"first_name":"Alessandro","host_name":"Alessandro","id":20808666,"is_superhost":false,"last_name":"prune_me","picture_url":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/20808666/profile_pic/1409593559/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/20808666","profile_pic_path":"https://a2.muscache.com/im/users/20808666/profile_pic/1409593559/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium"}},{"comments":"Convenient location, lots of restaurants and pubs nearby, and the flat is clean and tidy.","id":35931856,"localized_date":"June 2015","response":"","review_vote":{"downvote_count":null,"has_upvoted":false,"listing_id":5322843,"review_id":35931856,"upvote_count":null},"reviewee":{"first_name":"Alex","host_name":"Alex","id":20998252,"is_superhost":false,"last_name":"prune_me","picture_url":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/20998252/profile_pic/1410851791/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/20998252","profile_pic_path":"https://a1.muscache.com/im/users/20998252/profile_pic/1410851791/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium"},"reviewer":{"first_name":"Maverick","host_name":"Maverick","id":32835194,"is_superhost":false,"last_name":"prune_me","picture_url":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/32835194/profile_pic/1431011643/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium","profile_path":"/users/show/32835194","profile_pic_path":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/32835194/profile_pic/1431011643/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium"}},{"comments":"A really nice and large flat in a good location.
